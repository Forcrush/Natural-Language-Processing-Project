{"balanced-0": {"label": 1, "text": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to the global warming alarm is a refreshing change from the Obama administration\u2019s na\u00efve and hugely expensive crusade to lead the world to \u2018save the climate.\u201d\nNot only has Trump been right on the money in his descriptions of the sub-prime science underlying the scare. He also clearly understands that there is little chance the developing world, the source of most of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, will follow the US lead anyway, as it strives to lift billions out of poverty. These nations don\u2019t even have to. There is an \u201cout\u201d clause for developing countries in the United Nations treaty on which the Paris Agreement is based.\nTrump has started out well. First, he appointed Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u00a0and chair of the Cooler Heads Coalition, to head up the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition team.\nAs one of the \u2018climate criminals\u2019 targeted by activists in wanted posters across Paris during the December 2015 UN climate conference, Ebell is no stranger to controversy. He has faced up to aggressive global warming campaigners for years on television and radio, in newspapers and public presentations, and in his advocacy for solid science and affordable, plentiful, reliable energy.\nNext, Trump selected Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to run the\u00a0EPA. Like Ebell, Pruitt is a climate realist. He wrote in the National Review in May of this year, \u201cScientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged \u2013 in classrooms, public forums and the halls of Congress. It should not be silenced with threats of prosecution. Dissent is not a crime.\u201d\nClimate activists are outraged that such people will now have significant influence over America\u2019s, and indeed the world\u2019s climate, environment and energy policies. Craig Rucker, Executive Director of the Washington DC-based Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, sums up the reaction to Trump\u2019s appointments: \u201cThe sheer panic and harsh criticism emanating from the Left, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, only validates that he must be \u2018saying and doing all the right things.\u2019\u2019\u201d\nDespite listening to people from across the political spectrum on these issues, even meeting with former Vice-President Al Gore on Tuesday, it seems unlikely that Trump will change his mind on climate change. Yet, conservatives cannot afford to withdraw from the fight and simply assume that things will continue to go their way after Inauguration Day.\nAfter all, Trump has not been a consistent opponent of global warming hysteria over the years. He was a registered Democrat from 2001 to 2008, and a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, which identifies climate change as its first \u201cissue area.\u201d\nIn 2009, Trump, along with Ivanka, Donald Junior and Eric Trump, signed an\u00a0open letter to President Obama and Congress supporting \u201cmeasures to control climate change,\u201d even though doing so is a physical impossibility. The letter, published in the\u00a0New York Times December 6, 2009, implored:\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t postpone the Earth. If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.\u201d\nSo, like former Canadian prime Minister Stephen Harper, who campaigned for office as a climate skeptic, but changed sides after being elected, Trump could end up again supporting climate alarmism if realists don\u2019t strongly support his current policies \u2026 and hold his feet to the fire if he waivers.\nAlready, climate activists and their allies in the scientific community are working hard to change Trump\u2019s mind on global warming:\n* November 17:\u00a0An\u00a0open letter signed by thousands of women scientists was released. They claimed to fear that \u201cscientific progress and momentum in tackling our biggest challenges, including staving off the worst impacts of climate change, will be severely hindered under this next U.S. administration. Our planet cannot afford to lose any time.\u201d\nYet, the 2013 report of the\u00a0Nongovernmental International Panel\u00a0on Climate Change (NIPCC) cited hundreds of research papers published in leading science journals, demonstrating that today\u2019s climate change is nothing to fear. In particular, they concluded that \u201cneither the rate nor magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979\u20132000) lies outside normal natural variability, nor was it in any way unusual compared to earlier episodes in Earth\u2019s climatic history.\u201d\nCurrent climate change is so slow \u2013 1.5 degrees between 1880 and 2012, according to the United Nations \u2013 that we have plenty of time to properly consider alternative points of view on this complex topic.\n* November 30:\u00a0The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released\u00a0an open letter\u00a0it had coordinated to Trump and Congress. The 2,300 scientist endorsers worried that, without adequate research resources, \u201cwe will be less prepared to limit the impacts of increasing extreme weather.\u201d\nThis too is misleading. As the NIPCC report explained: \u201cThe commonly held perception that twentieth century warming was accompanied by an increase in extreme weather events is a misconception fostered by excessive media attention, and has no basis in facts.\u201d\n* December 6:\u00a0Over 800 energy and earth science researchers signed\u00a0another open letter\u00a0to Trump, urging him to \u201ctake immediate and sustained action against human-caused climate change.\u201d\nThe letter is riddled with mistakes. Besides the UCS extreme weather blunder, they erroneously labelled plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide as \u201ccarbon pollution.\u201d They claim the science backing the scare is \u201cunequivocal,\u201d a claim that is irrational in any scientific endeavor and especially one this immature.\nThey said that \u201cvirtually all climate scientists\u201d disagree with Trump, an assertion easily disproved by the NIPCC reports; dozens of open letters and other documents endorsed by leading climate experts; former space scientists, engineers and astronauts with The Right Climate Stuff group; and a statement by\u00a031,487 American scientists expressing extreme doubt about manmade climate cataclysms.\nBacking all this up is the continuous global warming drumbeat from mainstream media. The National Geographic Society provided a good example in \u201cThe Global Dangers of Trump\u2019s Climate Denial,\u201d in which it erroneously claimed that \u201cTrump\u2019s stance on climate change runs counter to physical evidence [and] near-universal scientific consensus....\u201d\nTo counter such reporting, Trump must promote solid science to justify his position. In particular, the president-elect must be convinced to make full use of reports such as those of the NIPCC to demonstrate that much of what activists say about climate change is simply wrong.\nOtherwise, history may repeat itself \u2013 and like Harper and both President Bushes, Trump may yield to the aggressive climate movement. That would be a disaster for the United States, and indeed for all nations that rely on a prosperous America for freedom.\nRepublicans ... and what is left of moderate Democrats who care about working class Americans ... must get behind EPA Administrator nominee Scott Pruitt. He is truly a leader who has the character, wisdom, legal skills and understanding to lead the EPA in a new, more constructive direction."}, "balanced-1": {"label": 1, "text": "A Bad Year for Climate Alarmists\n\nThis has been a very bad year for climate alarmists. On the threshold of worldwide enactment of the Kyoto Protocol, the Russians are saying \u0093nyet,\u0094 and scientists around the world are busy ripping the rug out from under alarmist climate predictions.\n\nFirst the science. Climate alarmists advocating Kyoto have long built their case on the claim that recently observed warming is historically unusual, and is therefore likely to be caused by human action. But since nobody was taking the Earth\u0092s temperature a thousand years ago, the claim that humans are changing the climate rests on a relatively simplistic theory about how the climate works, and on comparisons of recent temperatures with those derived from \u0093proxy\u0094 indicators of past temperature, such as tree rings, and coral shell characteristics. The most alarmist \u0093reconstruction\u0094 of past temperatures was developed by a researcher named Michael Mann, and his 1998 temperature reconstruction (shaped something like a hockey stick laying flat with its blade in the air), which led the United Nations Climate Panel to claim \u0093that the 1990s has been the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year of the millennium\u0094 for the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nBut skeptical scientists have doubted this representation of past climate for decades. Many scientists studying ancient climates found evidence that past ages had climate shifts to temperatures considerably warmer than today, shifts that happened more quickly than recently observed climate change. The most recent warm period scientists have identified is the Medieval Warm Period, which happened about 1000 years ago. The most recent cold snap scientists have identified is called the Little Ice Age, which happened from about 1300 to 1900 AD. To support the hockey stick against challengers, alarmists have worked hard to classify both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as \u0093local phenomena,\u0094 and thus, not meaningful indicators of global climate.\n\nBut two recent studies have badly damaged the hockey stick. The first study, by Harvard Astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas, and her colleague Willie Soon, reviewed more than 200 climate studies, and confirms the that both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were global, not regional, phenomena. As Baliunas explains, \u0093For a long time, researchers have possessed anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of these climate extremes. For example, the Vikings established colonies in Greenland at the beginning of the second millennium that died out several hundred years later when the climate turned colder. And in England, vineyards had flourished during the medieval warmth. Now, we have an accumulation of objective data to back up these cultural indicators.\u0094\n\nThe most recent study to crack the hockey stick was, appropriately enough, by Canadian researchers Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre. The two Canadians obtained the very same data sets and methods ostensibly used by Mann in constructing the hockey stick, and ran an audit on the data and calculations. Their findings were shocking. The Mann dataset, they found, contained numerous errors in data handling. Critical data sets were truncated or extrapolated unreasonably; some of the data was obsolete, there were errors where temperature records were erroneously linked to the wrong geographical location, and there were errors in various calculation methods.\n\nMcKitrick and McIntyre fixed the errors, re-ran the calculations using Mann\u0092s own methods, and lo and behold, no more hockey stick. Instead, the repaired climate reconstruction looks a bit more like the side view of a pie plate, with high global temperatures seen around 1000 years ago, a dip into a cold spell till around 1900, and a return to warmer temperatures over the last 100 years.\n\nNow to the politics. For the Kyoto Protocol to actually come into force as a binding international treaty, it has to be signed by 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions in 1990. Canada\u0092s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol brought treaty supporters close enough to the target that only one more country was needed: Russia. But the great bear is focused on putting its economic house in order, and furthermore, has scientists who are far more skeptical about climate change than their colleagues in the West. So when Russian President Vladimir Putin, backed by prestigious scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, came out against the treaty at the recent World Climate Change Conference in Moscow, there was a collective groan of anguish among climate alarmists, who are now desperate to get the treaty into effect before still other studies in the wings continue to rip the underpinnings out of their alarmist scenarios."}, "balanced-2": {"label": 1, "text": "Ocean Temperature Changes Are Uneven And Uncertain\nA new paper from the Global Warming Policy Foundation looks at how scientists monitor changes in ocean temperature and finds a story of huge uncertainties and surprising findings.\nFor example, while warming might be expected to be fairly uniform, measurements suggest that it is regionalised, with parts of the South Pacific, in particular, warming more than elsewhere.\nAs the report\u2019s author, Dr David Whitehouse, says, it is hard to draw firm conclusions about what is happening in the seas:\n\u201cThe oceans can absorb far more heat than the atmosphere, so temperatures changes are extremely small and therefore hard to measure reliably.\u201d\n\u201cThe energy that would raise the temperature of the atmosphere by 4 degrees C would only raise the ocean temperature by a thousands of a degree, barely detectable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasuring changes in the ocean heat content are at the limits of our current capability and are made with significant uncertainties and unknowns.\u201d\nA recent claim that warming of the oceans was accelerating had to be withdrawn after errors were found in its uncertainty estimates by an independent scientist."}, "balanced-3": {"label": 1, "text": "Examining the Claim That Renewable Energy Will Soon Replace Fossil Fuels\nAt virtually every public discussion of the issues surrounding global warming, there will inevitably be someone who will state, with absolute conviction, that the \u201csolution\u201d is already at hand because the global demand for fossil fuels is quickly declining, the costs of renewable energy are falling dramatically, and investment in renewables is increasing.\nLet us briefly examine each of these contentions using the facts and authoritative assessments available to us.\nWhere Are We Now?\nContext is always important, but never more so than when one is asked to believe future projections. In this case, we must be aware of how the global pattern of energy demand has changed in the past, and especially in the recent past. The most reliable authority on this is British Petroleum, which for many years has published annual \u201cstatistical reviews of world energy\u201d. The latest review, published in 2017, includes data and graphics that present the trends in global supply and demand for each of the major energy sources, as well as summaries of how the relative shares of each energy source, in terms of primary energy consumption, has changed over time.\nThe following graph illustrates how the shares of primary energy consumption met by different energy sources have changed over the period from 1966 to 2016.\nThere are several notable points about this background.\u00a0 First, the share of oil has declined steadily since the OAPEC oil embargo of 1973-74; nonetheless, oil continues to be the largest source of energy in the world, at about 34% of the total. The share held by coal has wavered up and down around 30% over the period but has remained in second place, and is now about 28%. Natural gas\u2019s share has steadily increased, despite the fact that until recently there was only limited transportation of gas in liquid form by tanker. Gas now holds about 25% of demand. Hydroelectricity has held its share in the range of 6% to 8%. Nuclear energy rose from next to nothing to about 7% but recently has declined to about 5%. Renewables, as represented mainly by wind and solar energy, has risen from next to nothing before 2000 to about 3% in 2016. In short, after half a century evolution of global energy markets, fossil fuels continue to provide 88% of global energy needs, while renewables play a rising but still very small part.\nThe following graph shows what that means in terms of the total level of energy consumption over time.\nThe graph shows how world energy consumption, as measured in terms of primary energy, rose from about 9,000 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 1991 to 13,300 MTOE in 2016, an increase of 47% over 25 years. The small dark orange part of the trend lines is renewable energy\u2019s share.\nWhat Will Happen In Future?\nThe reality is that no one knows what will happen to energy supply and demand in future. We can say with quite a lot of confidence that people\u2019s demands for energy services will lead developments, as various energy suppliers are motivated to respond to those needs. Supply and demand will also be affected by the prices of competing energy sources, and these in turn will be affected by resource availability, technological developments and other supply factors. The key demand factors are probably the trends in global population and in economic development in different regions.\nThere is a fairly small number of organizations in the world that have the information at hand and the capability to use advanced econometric modeling techniques to formulate projections of future energy supply, demand and emissions. The four most authoritative are the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), ExxonMobil and British Petroleum BP).\nI will use BP\u2019s projections for two reasons. First, of all the major forecasters, BP is the most willing to share the results of its analysis and data for free and in a form that allows clear comparisons of past and present trends. Second, BP\u2019s projections to 2035 are the most \u201cfavourable\u201d to renewables.\nThe following graphs show the future trends in comparison to the previously described past trends.\nIn summary:\nTo repeat, this is the most favourable outlook for renewables in any of the authoritative energy forecasting organizations. All the others show renewables holding a smaller share of global demand in 2035. No authority projects renewables to constitute even 20% of global energy demand, let alone 100%, in the period to 2050.\nThe Costs of Renewable Energy\nAdvocates of wind and solar energy constantly refer to how low the prices of these energy sources will be in future, while ignoring the costs that have been imposed on electricity ratepayers and on taxpayers up to now.\nThose historic costs, however, are enormous. They were essentially caused by the actions of several European and North American governments, in the name of addressing global warming, to accelerate the purchase and penetration in the electrical energy systems of renewable energy technologies that were not yet mature and far from competitive with existing generation sources. Typically, governments (in Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Canada to name a few) offered wind and solar suppliers several advantages over conventional electricity supply; these included:\nThe countries of the European Union have made the largest expenditures on renewable energy generation. The main source of data on generation costs there is the European Observer, an organization that actively promotes increased use of renewable energy. According to data from this source, to the end of 2014 European Union countries spent about 1.1 trillion EUR (CDN $1.68 trillion) on large-scale renewable energy installations. This provided a nominal nameplate generating capacity of about 216 gigawatts (GW), or nominally about 22% of the total European generation needs of about 1000 GW. The actual measured output by 2014 supplied by the renewables industry was 38 gigawatts, or 3.8% of Europe\u2019s electricity requirements, at a capacity factor of about 18% overall. Accounting for capacity factors, the capital cost of these renewable energy plants has been about 29 billion EUR (CDN $44.4 billion) per gigawatt.\nThe following table from the European Observer indicates the capital costs per GW of wind and solar energy technologies actually built through 2014.\nThus, the capital costs per unit of generation have ranged from 16 billion EUR (CDN $24.4 billion) per gigawatt for onshore wind to 63 billion EUR (CDN $96.1 billion) per gigawatt for solar PV on the grid, or an average of 30 billion EUR (CDN $45.8 billion) per gigawatt for the three main sources of renewable energy. The capacity factors actually achieved are important in determining these costs.\nNo wonder renewables advocates do not refer to these costs. Instead, they refer to the rates that have resulted from countries finally terminating the FIT contracting system and requiring renewables producers to sell their services through competitive bidding. The result has been a sharp reduction in the bids received.\nThe future costs of renewable energy depend not only on the current bids but also on the projected costs over the life of the systems. In the United States, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports on the comparative costs of different generation sources on a \u201clevelized\u201d basis. The levelized cost is essentially the expected real total cost (capital plus operating costs), in terms of dollars per megawatt/hour of different new generation technologies over the lives of the plants. The EIA updates these figures every few years.\nIn the EIA\u2019s 2017 updated version of the levelized cost of new generation sources, it estimates the U.S. national average costs for generation entering service in 2022. The EIA report can be read here:\nThe following table shows the 2017 estimates.\nU.S. Average LCOE (2016$/MWh) for Plants Entering Service in 2022\nNote that, partly because of lower natural gas prices, the natural gas-fired plants are projected to have the lowest LCOE, followed by onshore wind. The surprising change from the 2016 figures is the projected reduction in the LCOE of solar PV to U.S. $85 per MWh.\nThese figures are the bases for the claims by renewables advocates that wind and solar energy are now at or approaching \u201cgrid parity\u201d with conventional generation sources.\nThe Systemic, or Grid-Wide, Costs of Intermittent Energy\nThe LCOE approach measures mainly the projected direct costs of the generation plant technologies that will be built in the near future. It does not address the broader, or indirect, costs that the addition of renewable energy imposes on the electricity system.\nA number of analysts have examined further the differences between the costs of intermittent and dispatchable electricity generating technologies. A seminal paper was written by Paul Joskow of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and MIT in 2011. The paper can be found here.\nIn his abstract, Professor Joskow wrote, \u201c\u201d\nTo be more specific, the Joskow paper makes these points:\nLCOE analysis ignores the costs of backing up intermittent renewables and of the networks required to integrate them. Usually in North America, a large number of natural gas plants are required to stand ready, operating at very low capacity factors, to be available when demand is high and renewables generation is not available. Silvia Pariente-David, writing in the IAEE Forum in 2016, summarized the grid integration costs.\nShe went on to describe a less well known but important consideration, the \u201cmerit order\u201d effect of renewable energy (RE).\nThe article can be found here:\nIn other words, as the prices of renewable energy decrease and its role increases, it imposes ever-higher costs on the rest of the generation and transmission system. Advocates for renewable energy ignore these costs.\nQuestions About Future Investment in Wind and Solar\nDue to the significant costs of wind and solar generation to date, governments are increasingly facing opposition from the affected industries and residential consumers to reduce power rates. Some governments have initiated reviews of the design of the regulatory regime and the use of policy and fiscal instruments to attain certain predetermined levels of emissions reduction. The October 2017 Cost of Energy Review, led by Professor Dieter Helm in the United Kingdom, for example, pointed the way to a more economical approach to reducing GHG emissions. The report made two central recommendations.\nThe first was that the UK government should eliminate the vast array of subsidies, regulations, and programs by which it is now seeking to alter energy supply and demand patterns and instead replace them with one single, universally applied carbon price that would rise in accordance with the emissions reduction target.\nSecond, it recommended that, once the carbon price was in place, renewables suppliers should be required to bid on an \u201cequivalent firm power basis\u201d; in other words, they must be required to contract with a generator or a storage company able to provide electricity when there is no sun or wind. This would go a long way to removing the current system in which each additional producer of renewable energy shifts more of the system-wide costs of providing balancing and flexibility on to other energy suppliers or ratepayers. In addition to the ending of FIT rates and requiring that all procurement be done on the basis of competitive bidding, it would substantially reduce the pace of new renewables development.\nThe Helm Report can be seen here:\nIndeed, that process has already begun to some extent. After rising at the average annual rate of almost 20% per year from 2000 to 2011, global investment in renewable energy generation essentially flat-lined and has barely increased since then. This followed sharp reductions in the use of FIT contracting practices. The Energy Institute at Haas recently reported that 48 countries have replaced feed-in-tariffs with competitive auction systems, and another 27 are seriously considering do so. This has probably been the key factor in driving down the prices negotiated in new contracts. The European Union is now studying a proposal by the Council of European Energy Regulators to remove grid priority for renewable energy and reduce the compensation when renewable energy is curtailed. These two changes, if approved, would severely cut back investment in renewable energy in Europe.\nThe next bar chart plots investments in renewable generation over the period since 2000. Between 2001 and 2011 investment grew at almost 20% a year, but after 2011 it flattened out\nSource: Carbon Brief/International Energy Agency data\nEuan Mearns, writing on the blog , analyzed the reasons for this stabilization in spending.\nMearns also pointed out that the reduction in the prices bid for renewable energy supplied is not entirely beneficial to the renewables industry.\nMearns\u2019 article can be read here:\nThe journal  published an analysis of the region-by-region breakdown in global renewables investment. According to it, European renewables investment has been in decline since the second quarter of 2011 and shows no sign of a recovery. Investment in the USA has remained essentially flat. Investment in China grew before the second quarter of 2015 but has fallen off. Investment in the rest of the world has also failed to increase. The post-2011 flattening, in short, is a worldwide phenomenon.\nNo authoritative source of energy supply and demand projections sees renewable energy rising above 10% of global energy consumption by 2035. In fact, they all foresee fossil fuels continuing to supply by far the majority of the world\u2019s energy needs.\nThe extremely large costs incurred by the countries that have given preferential contracts and system access to wind and solar energy from 2000 to 2015 have raised electricity prices sharply in those countries and provoked strong opposition to the continuation of such policies. The movement away from feed-in-tariffs towards procurement by competitive bidding has led to much lower prices, but also flattened the growth in investments. If, as some European countries are now considering, intermittent energy supplies are required to bear a larger share of the system costs previously imposed on other generators and electricity ratepayers, the incentive to invest in wind and solar may decline further.\nThere is no evidence that wind and solar energy will soon fully replace fossil fuels even in the power generation industry, let alone in the entire economy. It is important that the public be better informed about this, so that the wrong policy choices will not be made."}, "balanced-4": {"label": 1, "text": "Shorten\u2019s latest \u2018dumb\u2019 climate response \u2013 \u201ccost of\u00a0inaction\u201d\nBrainless buffoonOn ABC last night, Bill Shorten last night called anyone questioning Labor\u2019s climate policy \u201cdumb\u201d.

The loss and damage element allows countries to claim losses and damages purportedly caused by climate change, such as infrastructure being destroyed by a severe storm or crops lost to drought.\nThe new provisions signed in Katowice give the countries in the Paris climate agreement until 2024 to file their first biennial transparency and national inventory reports, including reports of any damages they claim were caused by anthropogenic climate change.\n\u2018To Ensure Greater Socialism\u2019\nEfforts to establish national liability for purported climate damages are motivated by political and monetary gain, not environmental concern, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment & Climate News.\n\u201cThe bureaucratic activists pushing these policies have no desire to accomplish anything for the environment but are instead attempting to extract money from the richer countries and to ensure greater socialism around the world,\u201d Lehr said. \u201cThere is no doubt countries will count as much damage from weather events as possible as being caused by climate change, with all the reported damages falsely attributed to carbon dioxide emissions, as if nature had no role.\n\u201cPart of the push for this is to put more pressure on the United States to commit to reducing fossil fuel use,\u201d said Lehr. \u201cThis pressure will come both from countries that compete with us economically and from within the United States itself, from the leftists who now control our Congress.\u201d\nRaising the Pressure\nThe loss and damage provisions are aimed at putting more pressure on countries to cut carbon dioxide emissions, says David Wojick, Ph.D., a former consultant with the Office of Scientific and Technical Information at the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\u201cAssuming what they believe is true, they could perfectly well think if countries had to start to pay compensation for the damages they caused, they would act more quickly and decisively to reduce future damages,\u201d Wojick said. \u201cThat would mean they would, for example, sharply cut carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d\nSetting Up Lawsuits?\nWojick says the loss and damages provisions are the first step in building legal cases against the supposed perpetrators of climate change, with claims for damages that will be much larger than any lawsuits filed up to this point.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen domestic climate change lawsuits filed by cities and groups, but this is going to be nation against nation,\u201d Wojick said. \u201cThis is going to be staggering. There are going to be hundreds of billions of dollars involved.\n\u201cEach time somebody or a country tries to claim, for instance, all the damage from every hurricane is due to human-induced climate change, somebody needs to challenge the claim and not just let it stand, because it\u2019s building a record other countries and industries are going to get sued based on,\u201d Wojick said. \u201cIn damage litigation, the first thing you have to do is build a case. You have to say what the damages are, demonstrate they have occurred, and that the liable parties are actually liable.\u201d\nOpportunity for Skeptics?\nInternational climate liability lawsuits will create an opportunity for skeptical climate scientists to get a hearing for their point of view, which is currently being silenced, says Wojick.\n\u201cThe interesting question will be to what extent in the reporting of loss and damages they\u2019re going to call upon the science community to support their cases,\u201d said Wojick. \u201cThese lawsuits could present an opportunity for scientists and researchers who are skeptical of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change to make their case in a public forum.\n\u201cFinally, governments being sued are going to want to pay those skeptical of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s view humans are causing dangerous climate change to work on the case,\u201d Wojick said. \u201cThe experts on the side of the people, industries, and countries being sued for damages will present experts saying we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nLinnea Lueken (linnea.heartland@gmail.com) writes from South Carolina."}, "balanced-6": {"label": 1, "text": "London museum goes FULL WOKE with Extinction Rebellion\u00a0exhibits\nHopefully these XR morons will go extinct before the rest of usUPDATE:\u00a0Read Julie Burchill on the internal cracks forming in XR here\u00a0(PDF).

Given the high costs of the suggested solutions, could it be that the suggested cure is worse than the disease?\nAs a liberal who grew up in a solar house, I have always been energy conscious and inclined towards activist solutions to environmental issues. I was therefore extremely surprised when my research as an astrophysicist led me to the conclusion that climate change is more complicated than we are led to believe. The disease is much more benign; and a simple palliative solution lies in front of our eyes.\nTo begin with, the story we hear in the media, that most of the 20th century warming is anthropogenic, that the climate is very sensitive to changes in CO2, and that future warming will therefore be large and will happen very soon, is simply not supported by any direct evidence, only a shaky line of circular reasoning. We \u201cknow\u201d that humans must have caused some warming, we see warming, we don\u2019t know of anything else that could have caused the warming, so it adds up.\nHowever, there is no calculation based on first principles that leads to a large warming by CO2, none. Mind you, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports state that doubling CO2 will increase the temperatures by anywhere from 1.5 to 4.5\u00b0C, a huge range of uncertainty that dates back to the Charney committee from 1979.\nIn fact, there is no evidence on any time scale showing that CO2 variations or other changes to the energy budget cause large temperature variations. There is however evidence to the contrary. 10-fold variations in the CO2 over the past half billion years have no correlation whatsoever with temperature; likewise, the climate response to large volcanic eruptions such as Krakatoa.\nBoth examples lead to the inescapable upper limit of 1.5\u00b0C per CO2 doubling\u2014much more modest than the sensitive IPCC climate models predict. However, the large sensitivity of the latter is required in order to explain 20th century warming, or so it is erroneously thought.\nIn 2008 I showed, using various data sets that span as much as a century, that the amount of heat going into the oceans in sync with the 11-year solar cycle is an order of magnitude larger than the relatively small effect expected from just changes in the total solar output. Namely, solar activity variations translate into large changes in the so called radiative forcing on the climate.\nSince solar activity significantly increased over the 20th century, a significant fraction of the warming should be then attributed to the sun, and because the overall change in the radiative forcing due to CO2 and solar activity is much larger, climate sensitivity should be on the low side (about 1 to 1.5\u00b0C per CO2 doubling).\nIn the decade following the publication of the above, not only was the paper uncontested, more data, this time from satellites, confirmed the large variations associated with solar activity. In light of this hard data, it should be evident by now that a large part of the warming is not human, and that future warming from any given emission scenario will be much smaller.\nAlas, because the climate community developed a blind spot to any evidence that should raise a red flag, such as the aforementioned examples or the much smaller tropospheric warming over the past two decades than models predicted, the rest of the public sees a very distorted view of climate change \u2014 a shaky scientific picture that is full of inconsistencies became one of certain calamity.\nWith this public mindset, phenomena such as that of child activist Greta Thunberg are no surprise. Most bothersome however is that this mindset has compromised the ability to convey the science to the public.\nOne example from the past month is an interview I gave Forbes. A few hours after the article was posted online, it was removed by the editors \u201cfor failing to meet our editorial standards\u201d. The fact that it has become politically incorrect to have any scientific discussion has led the public to accept the pseudo-argumentation supporting the catastrophic scenarios.\nEvidence for warming doesn\u2019t tell us what caused the warming, and any time someone has to appeal to the so called 97 percent consensus he or she is doing so because his or her scientific arguments are not strong enough. Science is not a democracy.\nWhether or not the Western world will overcome this ongoing hysteria in the near future, it is clear that on a time scale of a decade or two it would be a thing of the past. Not only will there be growing inconsistencies between model and data, a much stronger force will change the rules of the game.\nOnce China realizes it cannot rely on coal anymore it will start investing heavily in nuclear power to supply its remarkably increasing energy needs, at which point the West will not fall behind. We will then have cheap and clean energy producing carbon neutral fuel, and even cheap fertilizers that will make the recently troubling slash and burn agriculture redundant.\nThe West would then realize that global warming never was and never will be a serious problem. In the meantime, the extra CO2 in the atmosphere would even increase agriculture yields, as it has been found to do in arid regions in particular. It is plant food after all."}, "balanced-8": {"label": 1, "text": "We hear it over and over, \u201cClimate change is real. Only industry-funded \u2018deniers\u2019 disagree.\u201d\nThis is ridiculous.\nIf anyone could rationally be labeled climate change deniers, it is those who hold the absurd view that our climate was relatively tranquil until the arrival of humans. They seem to not know that half of North America was under a vast ice sheet only 22,000 years ago. And, as Patterson has written, \u201cTen thousand years ago\u2026 temperatures rose as much as 6 degrees Celsius in a decade \u2014 100 times faster than the past century\u2019s 0.6 degrees Celsius warming.\u201d\nThe deniers label is an attempt to equate those who question political correctness on climate to Holocaust deniers. It is designed to frighten dissenters into silence. Besides having no place in civilized discourse, it is a fundamental error in reasoning, an \u201cad hominem\u201d logical fallacy \u2014 against the man, instead of the idea.\nAd hominem attacks are only one of the fallacies poisoning the climate debate. Campaigners regularly use guilt by association, straw man arguments and appeals to emotion, motive and authority to divert the public from considering the arguments of skeptics. Dr. Tim Ball, former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg, has even received death threats for his outspoken candor. Ball remarks, \u201cI didn\u2019t choose to be a climate skeptic for my health.\u201d\nSo rather than become embroiled in such unpleasantness, many of the world\u2019s leading climate experts stay out of the public debate, a serious loss to societies grappling with this important issue.\nProfessor Lennart Bengtsson, a leading Swedish climate scientist and research fellow at the University of Reading, is a case in point. After defecting from the climate alarmist camp and, two weeks ago, joining the advisory council of Britain\u2019s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a think tank of climate change skeptics, Bengtsson quickly decided to quit the group. In his resignation letter, he explained, \u201cI have been put under such an enormous group pressure in recent days from all over the world that has become virtually unbearable to me. If this is going to continue I will be unable to conduct my normal work and will even start to worry about my health and safety.\u201d\nThe idea that there is a consensus among experts that we face a human-caused climate crisis is unfounded. There has never been a reputable worldwide poll of climate scientists that demonstrates that a majority of them believe that our carbon dioxide emissions cause dangerous climate change. Australia-based climate data analyst John McLean has demonstrated that, even among the thousands of scientists who worked on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, only a few dozen of them actually commented on the issue, and some of those disagreed with the view that activists attribute to all of them.\nStatements by national science academies are equally unsubstantiated. Not a single national science body that officially supports the climate scare has demonstrated that a majority of their scientist members actually agree with their academy\u2019s position. Their statements are simply the politically expedient opinions of the groups\u2019 executives, or small committees appointed by the executives.\nThe lack of any known consensus is not surprising. Dr. Chris Essex, professor of applied mathematics at The University of Western Ontario explains, \u201cClimate is one of the most challenging open problems in modern science. Some knowledgeable scientists believe that the climate problem can never be solved.\u201d\nNot only are today\u2019s computerized climate models (the basis of the alarm) not known to represent climate properly, they cannot be programmed to do so because we do not know the underlying science well enough to know what to program the computers to compute. Yet, on this basis, the developed world is revamping its entire energy infrastructure.\nThe most comprehensive reports about the current state of climate science are those of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). Citing thousands of peer-reviewed scientific references published in the world\u2019s leading science journals, NIPCC reports show clearly that today\u2019s climate is not unusual and the evidence for future climate calamity is weak. Yet, fearing angry backlash from climate campaigners, governments worldwide ignore the NIPCC, choosing instead to base policy only on the IPCC.\nOur leaders must seek input from all reputable experts, regardless of their scientific opinion. Considering what\u2019s at stake \u2014 a human-induced eco-collapse if alarmists are correct, or, if skeptics are right, a waste of trillions of dollars and a loss of millions of jobs \u2014 no other approach is acceptable.\n[Originally published at\u00a0The Garden Island]"}, "balanced-9": {"label": 1, "text": "In a recent article in Forbes, Charles McConnell, executive director of Rice University\u2019s Energy and Environment Initiative, says what I and others at The Heartland Institute have long maintained: the United States is setting itself up for an entirely preventable energy disaster.\nMcConnell says the U.S. electric power grid is being stretched to the brink of failure from a major weather event or terror attack, as anti-climate policies and renewable energy subsidies and mandates force dependable nuclear and coal-fired power plants to close, replacing them with increasing amounts of less secure, less resilient, and less reliable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, or even natural gas.\nMcConnell\u2019s warning is particularly telling because it comes from a former assistant secretary of energy at the U.S. Energy Department for the Obama administration, the administration whose actions are largely responsible for the energy crisis the country is potentially facing.\nMcConnell writes, \u201cCoal and nuclear plants are unmatched in their ability to generate reliable energy under all circumstances, but these plants are being retired at an alarming rate because of a combination of punitive regulations, low natural gas prices, and government subsidies and mandates for renewables.\u201d As McConnell notes, coal and nuclear plants in the Midwest and Northeast running at full capacity were critical to keeping people\u2019s lights on and their homes heated during the polar vortex of 2014.\nMost Americans take electricity for granted. McConnell calls peoples\u2019 belief the U.S. electric power system can continue to remain reliable and resilient even as climate regulations and renewable energy mandates shut down coal and nuclear plants \u201cmagical thinking.\u201d\nElectricity cannot be reliably and inexpensively stored. Instead, it must be available whenever users demand it. Wind and solar power, which produce power only when nature cooperates, can\u2019t fit that bill.\nI\u2019m a fan of natural gas power. As gas prices have fallen, my electric bills have generally declined. Competition with natural gas plants is the primary reason some coal-fired power plants and nuclear plants have recently closed or are slated for early retirement. On cost alone, however, if one is concerned about price volatility, coal beats natural gas in many cases as a long-term fuel source. Unlike natural gas, the price of coal is less prone to rise or fall in response to weather or surging demand from alternative uses. This fact is reflected in my monthly power bills, where every bump in gas prices can double my monthly gas (winter) and electric (summer) bill.\nIn addition to price volatility, McConnell notes resilience and reliability during a crisis are a concern:\n[N]atural gas is less secure than coal and nuclear power because it relies on pipeline supply of fuel on demand.\nA base-load power plant typically stores in excess of a 30-day supply of coal on site, enough to outlast potential disruptions. Natural gas plants require a constant on-demand supply of gas to continue producing electricity [and] a weather shock, pipeline repair, unforeseen human mistake or a terror attack can quickly disrupt operations at those plants.\nMcConnell\u2019s article is timely, coming as The Heartland Institute has recently released our series of four studies demonstrating the continuing criticality of coal-fired power plants to grid reliability and price stability. These studies examine in detail the myriad regulatory factors and behind-the-scenes political machinations driving the premature retirement of dozens of valuable coal-fired power plants.\nAbsent federal action to account for the value of coal and nuclear plants\u2019 on-site storage capacity or governments ending their various subsidies for and mandates to use wind and solar power, people are likely to wake up from their fantasy land where electricity magically appears at the flick of a switch, instead finding the world a darker, colder (or hotter) place than they remembered, a world where electric power on demand is a luxury one can\u2019t count on.\nAmericans should ask the people of Venezuela, where my wife is from, for example, how that is working out.\n\u2014H.

When they first announced the project, climate blogger Anthony Watts listed myriad reasons ir was a foolish idea, not the least of which were the high costs of infrastructure and the fact solar panels were not really suited to carry heavy traffic.\nThough Watts didn\u2019t mention it, I will: it also seems to me having cars parked on top of or traveling over the panels, since neither cars nor their occupants are translucent, would defeat the purpose of capturing the sunlight and transforming it into electricity. It\u2019s like putting solar panel on top of a home\u2019s foundation but underneath the home itself, not a lot of light is going to get through.\nIf this were solely a private project, I would have no objection, and I might even get a good laugh out of it. When people throw away their own money on inane attempts to fight climate change, it is nobody\u2019s business but their own. Unfortunately, there is rarely a foolish climate mitigation plan federal or state governments won\u2019t take hard money from taxpayers to promote, and Solar Roadways is no exception. The project\u2019s developers were able to convince the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to give them more than $2,350,000 of hard-earned taxpayer money in Small Business Innovation Research grants for the project.\nThe developers had to replace the first two sets of solar panels on the test roadway in Sandpoint, Idaho in short order. \u201cTwenty-five of the first thirty test panels died within the first few weeks,\u201d writes Willie Eschenbach at Watts Up with That. \u201cThey were replaced by panels that delaminated. \u2026 So the delaminated panels were replaced again. But to be fair, who would have ever guessed that driving loaded semi-trucks over solar panels might do some damage?\u201d\nDuring the solar project\u2019s first 378 days of operation, the system produced about 246 kWh of electricity. Eschenbach calculates, based on the 15 cents per kWh he pays for electricity in California (where, due to climate policies, the cost of electricity is much more than what many people pay around the country; I pay 7.8 cents per kWh, for example), the solar project produced $36.86 worth of electricity at a cost of $4,450,000. What a costly boondoggle.\nSOURCE: Watts Up With That\nJim Steele, author of Landscapes and Cycles, published a new paper on Climate Etc. arguing groundwater discharge into the oceans is contributing to sea level rise. This is a missing factor unaccounted for by climate models. Once properly accounted for, the amount of sea level rise attributable to anthropogenic warming is much less than climate models estimate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges it cannot account for as much as 25 percent of the sea level rise. The IPCC\u2019s 2002 report stated, \u201cthe historic rise started too early, has too linear a trend, and is too large.\u201d\nGroundwater slowly discharges into the oceans over time, with the rate and amount varying dependent on periodic shifts in ocean currents, rainfall amounts, and rates of aquifer recharge, among other factors. Climate models do not take into account groundwater discharge into the world\u2019s oceans, yet the volume of fresh water stored as groundwater is second only to the amount of water frozen in Antarctica\u2019s icy expanse, and it is three to eight times the amount of water contained in Greenland\u2019s glaciers.\nOn relatively short time scales, during periods of frequent La Ni\u00f1as, a greater proportion of precipitation falls on the land globally \u201cand when routed through more slowly discharging aquifers, sea level rise decelerates. During periods of more frequent El Ni\u00f1os, more rain falls back onto the oceans, and sea level rise accelerates. In contrast to La Ni\u00f1a induced shallow-aquifer effects, deep aquifers have been filled with meltwater from the last Ice Age, and that water is slowly and steadily seeping back into the oceans today,\u201d writes Steele.\nAs Steele explains in detail, deep aquifers are constantly discharging water into oceans, and \u201cprimarily regulated by geological pore spaces (in addition to pressure heads), the slow and steady discharge of these older waters affects sea level rise on century and millennial timeframes.\u201d This discharge could account for a large portion of, if not all, unaccounted-for sea level rise.\nUntil climate models account for the volume of water the world\u2019s shallow and deep aquifers discharge into the oceans, the amount of sea level rise they attribute to human causes should be considered inaccurate.\nSOURCE: Climate Etc.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supported oil producer EOG Resources\u2019 request to be allowed to kill a shareholder resolution on climate change preemptively, without a vote. The SEC\u2019s action could indicate a significant shift in the way it analyzes shareholder resolutions under the administration of President Donald Trump.\nOn behalf of the Sierra Club Foundation, Trillium Asset Management, the oldest investment management firm pushing social and environmental change through stock ownership, proposed a shareholder resolution calling on EOG to set a target and timetable to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Trillium, founded in 1982, manages approximately $2.5 billion in assets.\nIn a December 20, 2017 letter to SEC, EOG requested the commission allow it to exclude Trillium\u2019s resolution in the proxy materials it was required to send to shareholders for consideration at its annual meeting, and to preclude it from coming up for a vote at the meeting. Citing SEC rules, EOG stated Trillium\u2019s resolution interfered with matters\nso fundamental to management\u2019s ability to run a company on a day-to-day basis that they could not, as a practical matter, be subject to direct shareholder oversight, [and] \u2026the proposal seeks to \u2018micro-manage\u2019 the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.\nSEC agreed with EOG. In its February 26 letter responding to EOG\u2019s request, SEC said Trillium\u2019s proposal does attempt to \u201cmicromanage the Company,\u201d and thus under Commission rules, the agency allowed EOG to exclude the resolution from its annual meeting proxy materials and prevent it from being voted on.\nSEC\u2019s decision came after the agency issued new legal guidance in November 2017 broadening the definition of micromanagement as potential grounds to block shareholder proposals. Since 2010, nearly 130 resolutions have been filed asking companies to set timetables and/or standards for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or take other actions to fight climate change. Shareholders have rejected most such resolutions, usually by large margins.\nAccording to The Sustainable Investments Institute, historically SEC has disallowed similar climate shareholder resolutions only based on technical errors, such as filing the resolution late.

Larry Pickering said each year there is \u201ca fresh army of undergraduate marine biologists stream out of publicly funded universities intent on creating themselves jobs... No reef damage, no jobs!\u201d\nMatt Ridley publishes an all-encompassing rebuttal of the climate con and points to four principal reasons about why the risk from global warming is being exaggerated:\n1. All environmental predictions of doom always are wrong;\n2. the models have been consistently wrong for more than 30 years;\n3. the best evidence indicates that climate sensitivity is relatively low;\n4. the climate science establishment has a vested interest in alarm.\nGlobal temperatures, though returning to their long term average, remain at El Ni\u00f1o influenced high levels. Nonetheless, 2016 is likely to be the warmest in the 38 year satellite record.\nThe debacle of South Australia\u2019s electricity collapse has been laid at the feet of the wind industry; wind is not only three times the cost of fossil fuels but is unreliable.\nApparently unperturbed, two other Labor states, Queensland and Victoria are powering ahead with economy-crushing wind farms to displace the super efficient, reliable and low cost coal stations. In a piece of sleight-of-hand prepared by Queensland Government commissioned activists, the replacement of half existing power stations by wind farms is even claimed to impose trivial costs \u2013 though the small print reveals that\u2019s only because they assume a $40 carbon tax.\nAnd Victoria is pressing ahead with yet another layer of regulatory favours to green power under the rubric of a \u201cfairness\u201d reward for environmental benefits. While, as a result of such subsidies, the closure of the low cost Engie/Mitsui's brown coal Hazelwood power station is said by the Australian Financial Review to be imminent, providing price benefits to other suppliers at the expense of customers and the nation generally.\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Geophysical Letters Greenland is poised to return to the temporate climate that was promoted by those canny real estate marketers, the 12th Century Vikings.  Global warming on stilts but wait! According to a paper published in Nature earlier this year the warming in Greenland is localised due to \u201canomalously high geothermal flux\u201d underneath its ice sheet.\nUndiscouraged by the failure of his forecast ice free Arctic by the middle of this decade, scientist Peter Wadhams has put the clock back and now says it will be another two years. Matt Ridley covers the issue noting that the annual sea ice loss is less than in record years, that 6,000 years ago the Arctic was ice free and that, confounding forecasts, the Antarctic ice coverage continues to grow.  And Pierre Gosselin shows Wadhams to be an ultra alarmist in forecasting ice levels that are vastly lower than those from 29 other authorities.\nTo counteract all those studies that suggest there could not have been enough of human induced emissions to affect climate prior to the 1960s, an Australian study has said humans have had an effect for 200 years. The study was published in Nature and makes use of tree rings made famous by the statistical artefact Michael Mann used to \u201chide the decline\u201d of temperatures that is evident from the 12th to 19th centuries.\nMichael Mann also got into the act spouting inaccurate statements about what constitutes likelihoods of one in 1000 year events; he was chided by Tallbloke for these.\nParty spoilsport this time round was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which concluded \u201cno evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record\nEnglish celebrity scientist Brian Cox was brought to Australia to promote global warming.  He appeared with climate expert and newly elected senator Malcolm Roberts on the widely watched ABC program Q&A. Actually the chart Cox produced used data that had been manipulated to depict earlier periods as cooler than the data actually recorded, thereby \u201cconfirming\u201d global warming.  Jennifer Marohasy shows the amateurish if not deliberately misleading nature of Cox\u2019s assertions and has demonstrated how the data in Australia has been modified to provide spurious evidence of warming.\nAnd here from Tony Heller is the NASA data from 1999 \u201ccorrected\u201d with the inconveniently warmer 19th century data omitted.\nAbsent from Cox\u2019s charts was this one showing the earth has not warmed very much during the 40 years for which we have good (satellite based) data.  In contrast to the climate models, the actual trend, labeled \"real world\" below, is in line with the theoretical 1.2\u00b0C warming from the doubling of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that is the widely agreed effect without the controversial amplification due to water vapour.\nAll this manipulation, exaggeration and mysticism gives even greater credence to an excellent new book by Michael Hart Hubris: The Troubling Science, Economics, and Politics of Climate Change.  Hart argues the \u201cofficial science, the alliance of governments and bogus science, is a form of immorality pretending to be virtue\u201d.  He maintains, \u201cthe real issue is the hunger for power to change economic and political systems in order to achieve a wide-ranging agenda. In the words of former UNFCCC Secretary Christiana Figueres, the goal of \u2018the whole climate change process is the complete transformation of the economic structure of the world\u2019.\u201d\nRoss McKitrick writes that Ontario\u2019s wholesale electricity price, thanks in large part to the shale gas revolution, has trended down to two to three cents per kwh.  But consumers also have to pay a green power levy that adds another 10 -11 cents.  He says, \u201cElectricity is cheaper to make than it\u2019s been for a generation, yet Ontarians are paying more than ever.\u201d\nAustralian Energy and Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg confronts the same issues and addressed them on 28 August\u2019s Viewpoint (see podcast at 16 minutes).  Acknowledging that wind requirements create much dearer electricity, he said that the Labor Opposition and state Labor governments have even more ambitious and costly goals.  Australia, he maintained, should offset this by producing more electricity from gas (a route State governments are preventing).\nShareholders of major Australian corporate moocher, Infigen, are seeing payoffs from the firm\u2019s lobbying for subsidies.  Infigen\u2019s 2016 reported profit increased by 44 per cent.  Most revenues came from renewable energy subsidies, the value of which increased 81 per cent last year, when wind\u2019s subsidy averaged $70 per MWh, about tenfold its current EU equivalence.\nAt least Australia now seems likely to cut one part of its scandalous renewable energy charity, the $1.2 billion ARENA funding vehicle.  But, as its former CEO (and prior to that BP CEO) Greg Bourne shows in this interview, the agency will not go quietly.\nThe Paris Agreement in December is to establish an agreed international path to decarbonising economies.  Two of the four biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, China and India, have been given leave to simply pay lip-service to the policy but the EU and the US have been the major proponents.  Donald Trump has placed himself squarely in the skeptic camp on climate change, calling it a hoax and even joking that the whole issue is a Chinese plot but the Obama administration is trying to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the Paris Agreement (and bi-pass Congress by not calling it a \u201ctreaty\u201d) and to lock in emission reductions.\nLike others, Denmark is now pulling back on these economy-crushing subsidies. Meanwhile, across the Skagerrak, Sweden\u2019s state owned electricity utility, Vattenfall, has sold its German brown coal assets for $2.4 billion and is to pay $50 million a year in greengeld to buy and retire carbon credits.\nThe \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in the UK doubtless has implications for the debate though these are not yet clear and indeed, the UK set out even more intensive regulations fostering renewables on the assumption of a Remain victory.\nPrices of the tradeable permits were falling post Paris but recovered on the prospect of a \u201cRemain\u201d victory before tanking in the aftermath of the vote.\nWith costs of the renewable program alone ballooning out to $20 billion a year by 2020, in this piece I asked, \u201cCan the minor parties prevent energy policy crucifying the Australian economy?\u201d  The answer appears to be \u201cNo!\u201d as the nation\u2019s hung election has seen the likely loss of two climate skeptic Senators perhaps offset by two gains.  Added to the costs of direct subsidies and a government financial institution with $10 billion of soft loan funds for the green industry, on July 1 Australia commenced carbon trading. The system, called the \u201cSafeguard Mechanism\u201d covers the 150 companies that are responsible for about half of the nation\u2019s emissions.  Those firms reducing their emissions get credits, Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), which they can sell and those wanting to increase emissions have to buy such credits.\nA new survey of 650 scientists shows deep differences of view on the supposed anthropogenic causes of global warming, the extent that existing conditions are reflecting human influences on climate, including the extreme events and the veracity of the climate models.\nOne of James Cook University's professors, Peter Ridd, (an AEF board member) received international support after the university censured him for trying to blow the whistle on what he says is a lack of quality assurance in science examining the Great Barrier Reef. Analysis claimed that climate change had brought about disastrous and perhaps irreversible damage to the reef.  In fact the reef is undergoing one of its periodic dieback and resurrection periods, more than likely influenced by El Nino. The spurious findings promoted by leading climate worrier, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, milking and stoking the issue were eviscerated here where it was shown that the ebb and flow of coral bleaching is normal and the present extent far from unusual.\nMore on the politicisation of science generally is here and Science on the Verge assembles material by eight academics demonstrating the decline in standards of evidence in \u201cpeer reviewed\u201d publications. Among its observations is a paper in Science magazine claiming that precisely 7.9 per cent of the world\u2019s species would become extinct as a result of climate change, in spite of the total number of species being unknown. The paper proceeds to conclude that its findings show \u201cthe importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.\u201d Jeroen P. van der Sluijs, asks how do researchers jump from species extinction to carbon sequestration?\"  And he adds, \u201cThis sounds like an opinion for which the underlying arguments are not even given.\u201d\nThe Queensland government is trawling for extinctions claiming evidence indicates that the anthropogenic climate change-induced impacts of sea-level rise, coupled with a recent increased frequency and intensity of weather events that produced damaging storm surges and extreme high water levels, were most likely responsible for the extirpation of the Bramble Cay melomys from Bramble Cay.\nPersistant bias in estaqblishment \"peer reviewed\" scientific publications makes it unsurprising that The American Journal of Political Science published a paper which triumphantly associated conservatives with psychotic traits but later found the conclusions were based on a coding error and it is actually liberals who are the pschopaths!\nRecovery from el nino means global temperatures falling and 2016 no longer thought likely to be a record year\nGlobal warming was said to be causing unprecedented flooding of the Seine.  If so, it must have been hibernating in the years since 1910 as these photographs, unlike warmist spruikers, do not lie.\nFinally, we are reminded that carbon dioxide is vital to our existence and that it was only once atmospheric CO2 levels grew 13,000 years ago that we saw the beginning of agriculture.\nThe latest el Ni\u00f1o, which has created record temperatures and brought joy to the doomster warmistas, is finally subsiding.  Ocean temperatures are back to normal\nAnd the Mephiststophelian portends of drying continents are countered by the most expansive research to date which has shown negligible change in precipitation over the past century.And the\nThe UN climate change caravan moves from Paris to Bonn, next stop Marrakech.  According to the UN script the Bonn meeting saw countries push ahead with, \u201ca suite of positive outcomes\u201d; these are said to have implemented stronger climate action and constructed the global climate regime \u201crule book\u201d in order to guarantee the treaty\u2019s fairness, transparency and balance between nations. However, the Paris accord\u2019s agreed green \u201cadaptation and mitigation\u201d (i.e. funding bribes to mendicant states) of $100 billion per annum by 2020 is no closer to being achieved than balanced government budgets.  For 2016 the goal is $2.5 billion, which is described as ambitious.\nChina and India, the largest and third largest emitters, are merely paying lip service to any mitigation but the EU leadership remains committed.  And, although Hillary Clinton has declared she misspoke in saying \u201cWe're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\", she still proposes to cripple the US economy with a 50 per cent renewables program.\nDanish consensual homogeneity is legendary. In 2012, 95 per cent of MPs voted to get 50 per cent renewables by 2020 and in 2015 Denmark generated the equivalent of 42 per cent of its energy usage as well as having created a successful turbine export industry. But with 66 per cent of the electricity bill comprising taxes, the government has reversed course having decided that renewables are too expensive.\nPoland is among other countries that are also finding they are running up to the limits of cost acceptability for renewable energy. Germany has joined the doubters. It is now producing so much subsidised wind and solar that it must export surplus coal-generated electricity which it overproduces from plants necessary to be kept operating to ensure reliable electricity supply. Subsidies to renewables comprise 52 per cent of German electricity bills. It now plans to limit costs by auctioning rights for new solar facilities rather than allow the subsidy to all. One mooted solution, a European supergrid, might cost \u20ac400 billion and would only postpone the crisis.\nAt long last, there is a revolt of UK MPs against the carbon emission measures that are destroying the nation\u2019s industry. So far only 15 MPs have signed on to oppose price-boosting renewable regulations, while a rival group of MPs are urging firmer and more comprehensive measures to give greater confidence to investors (or more subsidies to their funders).\nFrance however, under a socialist government, remains solidly on the upward slope of the learning curve. Energy Minister, Segolene Royale is to press on with a CO2 tax that is at least 30 euros per tonne .\nThe climate debate has flickered throughout the current 75 day election campaign. Australia\u2019s Direct Action abatement subsidy scheme was introduced by the coalition government in 2014. The scheme operates by reverse auction, funding projects voluntarily proposed by the private sector. Because the government cannot know true project counterfactuals, the lowest auction bids are, according to this analysis, often likely to be non-additional \u201canyway\u201d projects.\nMy own view is that the two major parties have broadly equivalent carbon tax impositions up to 2030 (when costs are over $10 billion a year plus) but Labor also has uncosted land expropriation (using planning laws) and the Liberals claim they will achieve the goals more cheaply via their Direct Action plan. I offered some uncomplimentary comments on politicians\u2019 understanding of the costs of their carbon abatement bromides in an article in The Australian.\nAfter a very high recorded temperature in March, the el nino effect is now subsiding but Roy Spencer thinks the 2016 average temperature could still end up a record warm year in the post 1989 satellite data.\nThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) allows the monitoring of sea surface temperature patterns in the North Atlantic Ocean. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations such as European summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes and variations in global temperatures. The last major phase change (cold-to-warm) took place right around the mid-point of the 1990\u2019s. The AMO index has generally been descending during the past few years providing support to the notion that a cool-down is indeed occurring in the North Atlantic.\nGreen scams\nEarth Day came and went and was the landmark under which the wealth-crushing Paris climate Change agreement was signed by Obama and the collective. Andrew Follett reminds us of the forecasts that were made by the Earth Day promoters over the years: Famine, no oil, asphyxiation without gas masks.\nGreen energy is likely to discontinue its growth in developing countries. According to a spokesperson for Germany\u2019s energy ministry, that\u2019s because it is too expensive \u2013 who ever would have thought that?\nChina is not doing much harm to fossil fuelled generation. Its carbon emission allocations are so generous that the carbon tax effect of trading is below $1 per tonne.\nSegoline Royal, gossamer defender of the poor, is seeking to drive her constituents into poverty by promoting a carbon tax that almost doubles the cost of generated energy. Moreover, she and a sympathiser have been appointed to chair a World Bank-led initiative to provide support for governments and companies that want to put a price on carbon.  Segoline accolade was dwarfed by that given to climate hypocrite Leonardo DiCaprio, a UN 'messenger of peace'.\nNobody with genuine qualifications could ever be appointed to such a body. Indeed, Matt Ridley, distinguished scientific author, naturalist, PhD zoologist, columnist, applied for the chairmanship of the Natural History Museum and did not get an interview as he is a climate sceptic.\nMeanwhile, the carbon emissions scam has procreated a brand new underworld of people taking advantage of its artificially created value. A current case involves \u20ac1.4 billion worth of tax fraud, has been accompanied by murder and other mayhem and is one of 15 underway in France.\nClimate Hustle, which premiered at the Paris Climate Conference in December, has been released in the US. Marc Morano said, \u201cWe go through the tipping points. We show how the United Nations in the 1980s was predicting a 10-year tipping point, where we must act in order to fight global warming. \u201cWe have Prince Charles. We have Al Gore and a whole host of other people making ridiculous tipping points that have come and gone but they just draw a line and scratch out the old date and enter a new date. \u201cClimate Hustle\u201d contends that liberals (US style) insist that climate change is our greatest global challenge as a path to realloate wealth. The Australian Environment Foundation has asked to host showings of the film in Australia.\nebruary, having been billed as the hottest month on record, was followed by a cooler March as the el nino effect subsides.  If temperatures have been rising since the eighteenth/early nineteenth century\u2019s Little Ice Age, the data for the lower troposphere, uncontaminated by urban heat islands and the surface temperature casts doubt on the extent of the trend over recent years.\nWe have also seen a return of Arctic ice after a 2008 low.\nA major new paper published in Nature directly challenges the IPCC conclusions that a warmer climate will mean increased drought and flooding. The work uses tree rings (real evidence unlike alarmist Michael Mann\u2019s confected data using cones) and finds there was, \u201cconsiderably larger variations in rainfall and drought patterns during the past twelve centuries than in the twentieth century.\"\nDangerous anthropogenic warming questioned in another study by Francois Gervais which delved into the natural 60\u2013year cyclic component of temperature and concluded that human induced warming could be, at most, 0.6 \u00b0C and argued for a change of paradigm.  The study highlights a benefit for mankind related to the increase of plant feeding and crop yields by enhanced CO2 photosynthesis.\nThis renders redundant the fear-stoking claims that estimate limiting warming to 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) by 2100 would significantly reduce the \u2018Climate Value at Risk\u2019, the researchers found. The average value of global financial assets at risk would be US$1.7 trillion, with 1 per cent chance of US$13.2 trillion being at risk. In any event the cost estimates of such claims are absurd since they assume that if it is getting warmer people don't notice and don't adjust their behaviour in response!\nAll these doubts on the science are unlikely to halt the policy locomotive whereby the developed world reduce their emissions and cripple their economies while the developing nations do as they please.\nhese policies are significant contributors to the plight of the UK steel industry. Hammered by Chinese competition and carrying the baggage of renewables carbon tax of \u00a318 per tCO2 (in Australia that would be rather more than the total wholesale price of electricity) the UK steel industry continues its demise \u2013 an overseas relocation with no net global carbon savings!\nMinister Javid has proposed a cut in the renewables carbon tax.  But are politicians so stupid that they really did not think placing a massive impost on domestic industries which is not present on competitors' will not lead firms to depart?  Apparently they are. The UK renewables policy which raised costs by 26 per cent in 2014 will add 59 per cent to the energy costs in 2020.\nAs The Sun says, \"The (UK) PM\u2019s problem is that he personally signed the industry\u2019s death warrant by imposing a punitive carbon tax, which makes the energy to produce our steel twice as costly as Germany\u2019s. It began as a barking mad idea from Ed Miliband when he was Labour\u2019s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary.\"  Energy costs are 5-10 per cent of total costs of electricity but this post  argues only one percentage point is due to energy specific taxes.. The pusillanimousEngineering Employers Federation (EEF) says ($) \u201cEEF is not suggesting we should dismantle climate policy or stop investing in renewables.\nThe shrinking Australian industry is facing the same problem with steel producer Arrium facing bankruptcy having production costs far in excess of prices. Predictably, politicians are resorting to calls for protectionism.\nAll these renewable subsidies are not helping some of the renewable businesses.  Here are the outcomes for two of the biggest in Europe, suffering from the reduction in demand in Germany that is not compensated by the massive subsidies they receive.\nAnd in the US, SunEdison, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest green energy company, may soon file for bankruptcy.  It lost 95% of its value this last year.\nSunEdison has received $650M in subsidies since 2000, while the Spanish firm Abengoa is also close to bankruptcy in spite of getting subsidies of $605 million, and the most notorious, Solyandra, got $535 millions from the munificent Obama administration before going belly-up in 2011.\nCanada is moving down the same road.  Ontario ratepayers are set to be slugged $2.5 billion this year in prices caused by renewables.\nClimate alarmism had already lost all its scientific ground before 2001\", (when the IPCC redefined human induced climate change to any climate change). He goes on to say, \u201cSince then, it has been fighting exclusively in the power structures and in the media, using semantic trickery, lies, bribery, threats and abuse of power.\u201d An unlikely co-tormented would be IPCC insider Professor Myles Allen who says there is no point in the developed world consigning itself to poverty in suppressing emissions if the developing world does not follow suit.\nRemember to turn your lights on to celebrate Earth Day on April 22!  The day has been chosen for governments to \u201cplant a tree\u201d and formally sign the Paris agreement.\nThis man will surely be doing his bit, though campaigning in Wisconsin this month his bus ran out of fuel.

Simply put, externalities emerge when exchanges between two parties has consequences that spill over onto third parties. These externalities are labelled \u201cnegative\u201d when these spillovers hurt third parties.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions resulting from economic activity constitute a negative externality, as producers and consumers in any exchange do not pay the full social cost of their actions (present or future). This, economists argue, is a form of market failure. Economists then propose corrective policies for governments to enact. A good example of such a corrective policy is the carbon tax. Because it raises the price of pollution, it internalizes the externality.\n\nThe discussion generally ends with how further government interventions will internalize the externality. However, are there margins where greater reliance on markets and scaling back government intervention would constitute a superior course of action? In other words, is it possible that prior government actions made the problem larger so that it would be more accurate to speak of government failure? This possibility is rarely (if ever) discussed in the sphere of public affairs.\n\nYet, consider the example of highways in Quebec, which suggests that you can observe this possibility in your daily life. In the 1970s, the provincial government removed all tolls on highways. By eliminating road-pricing, the Government of Quebec reduced the cost of using an automobile and thus encouraged traffic jams, which are associated with greater levels of air pollution (in addition to the cost in time to commuters). The move away from road-pricing worsened the problem of air pollution, but that move was a move away from market mechanism. A hypothetical move back to road-pricing would reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and help mitigate climate change.\n\nWhile the example of Quebec highway suggests that this \u201cgovernment failure\u201d is ubiquitous, it does not speak to the contribution of \u201cgovernment failures\u201d to the overall problem. One could argue that, while valid, this argument explains only a small portion of the problem of climate change. Thus, most of the efforts should come from policies such as new regulations and/or a carbon tax.\n\nBut that would be incorrect.\n\nConsider the case of fossil fuel subsidies. In countries representing roughly one-third of the world\u2019s population, gasoline prices are reduced to artificially low levels. Because consumption is greater at these lower levels than it would be at the market price, the governments of these countries (which include India, China, Iran, Algeria, Venezuela and Egypt) must spend public funds to pay for the greater consumption. In essence, consumption of oil is subsidized. The environmental downside is that the incentives to invest in energy-saving technologies and to use energy more parsimoniously are weakened. The result is greater levels of GHG emissions and conventional air pollutants.\n\nIn the early 1990s, some economists had begun to point to the importance of this effect. For example, a World Bank study suggested that eliminating those subsidies in the 1980s would have reduced GHG emissions by between five and nine per cent. Such a reduction some three decades ago would also have affected downwards the trend of GHG emissions. In a more recent report, the OECD found that the immediate abolition of these subsidies would reduce GHG emissions by 10 per cent. Finally, the International Monetary Fund found that, if the subsidies were eliminated, emissions of carbon dioxide would fall by 4.5 billion tons representing 13 per cent of total emissions.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, the potential reduction found in the OECD study is enough to do a seventh of the effort needed to accomplish the ambitious objective of stabilizing GHG concentrations at 450 parts per million (thus limiting climate change to below two degrees Celsius). Alone, this policy packs quite a punch and it makes it hard to not consider seriously the possibility that government meddling with market processes made the problem even bigger than it was.\n\nImagine all the other policies\u2014including Quebec\u2019s move away from road-pricing\u2014and compare their effects to the impact of fossil fuel subsidies. Even if each policy is individually small, their sum may amount to much more. So maybe it is time to consider each of these small pebbles. This might open the road to a more modest, but more efficient, set of environmental policies that rely on the idea that, before doing anything, it\u2019s best to stop doing what makes things worse."}, "balanced-14": {"label": 1, "text": "uk met office confirms world average temperatures have plummeted following freak el nino\nNew official data issued by the UK Met Office confirms that world average temperatures have plummeted since the middle of the year at a faster and steeper rate than any any time in the recent past. \"The huge fall follows a report by this newspaper that temperatures have cooled after a record spike.

A key point made by Dr Ridd this morning is that there is absolutely no quality assurance of Great Barrier Reef research \u2013 research that they report on almost daily.\nChanges in temperature, acidity, and also turbidity (muddiness) are consequences of physical processes. Yet the media mostly interview biologists who assume changes, without actually measuring them and then set about establishing effects in fish tanks.\nOcean acidification, for example, is an area of research where, in less than 20 years, the number of published papers has increased from zero to 800 each year.   Sometimes the biologists have even added hydrochloric acid to artificially reduce the pH of the water in their fish tanks to mimic what their computer simulation models have determined must surely be our dystopian future.  The media headlines then incorrectly report the result as the current situation at The Great Barrier Reef \u2013 this makes for more and more fake news.\nMeanwhile, physicist Peter Ridd has been studying and measuring actual changes at the Great Barrier Reef for more than 35 years \u2013 contributing to a deeper understanding of many of the most important physical processes.\nFor example, if we are to measure the impact of sugarcane farming then we need to know how much muddier reef waters are now, relative to before European settlement.\nIn the wake of the very high-profile launch of the WWF Save the Reef Campaign back in June 2001, there was a flurry of newspaper articles. They reported that sediment was literally smothering the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.  Yet there was no evidence for this beyond some fake photographs that were exposed yesterday in the Federal Court by Peter Ridd\u2019s Barrister, Stuart Wood QC.  You can see these photographs in my last blog post.\nOver the years many biologists have been claiming that muddiness (caused by excess sediments) is a problem, and yet no one from the Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University has been interviewed about this.  At this laboratory there are physicists studying ocean tides, currents, waves and their effect on the concentration and distribution of the sediments, which are supposedly causing the problem.\nPeter Ridd joined the laboratory in 1989, as one of the first four post-doctoral fellows employed there. He is the only one to survive several decades as an academic at James Cook University, being promoted to Professor in 2008 and becoming the Head of Physics in the same year.\nProfessor Ridd began his career undertaking detailed measurements of turbidity with different instruments. He was interested in how to measure the advection of sediment (mud) and its resuspension by wave generated shear stresses.  This requires an understanding of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and wave theory.  So obsessed was he with the accuracy of these measurements that he invented new equipment so that more accurate measurements of turbidity (muddiness) could be recorded under the variety of different natural conditions \u2013 considering the vastness of the reef.\nOnce Peter Ridd had mastered this, he moved on to understand in more detail how sediments potentially carry pollutants, including fertilizers and pesticides, from farmland into reef waters. He was most interested in how these pollutants could potentially be mixed through turbulent diffusion and dilution, which are also complex physical processes.\nHe has also studied temperatures: heat fluxes from the sun, infrared radiation from the surface (Stefan Boltzmann Law), evaporative fluxes and latent, vertical mixing of hot water into the water column by waves (another physical mechanism).  These processes are now well documented including in some of his over 110 scientific publications.\nIt is now understood how pH (acidity) varies on a daily, seasonal and inter-annual basis, including with large fluctuations in temperature that is common across bodies of water, and also with water depth.  Yet the experiments in fish tanks, which some biologists persist with, fail to incorporate this variability into their design, or the interpretation of results.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a vast and complex ecosystem.  It is the case that the considerable daily variations in temperatures, pH and turbidity from natural processes still dwarf any measurable human impact.  While there are trends of increasing water temperature and pH at some locations, it is unclear to what extent these longer-term trends are part of existing natural cycles.\nPeter Ridd\u2019s life\u2019s work has been focused on understanding real physical processes in extreme detail.  In all of this, his interest has been on understanding the potential impacts of human activity on biological processes.\nOne of his most recent peer-reviewed publication is entirely about a biological phenomenon: coral calcification rates.  He measured coral extension and density and determined that corals like it hot!\nIt is a fact that most species of coral that live on the Great Barrier Reef also live in much warmer waters, closer to the Equator around Indonesia and Thailand.  Coral growth rates are closely linked to temperature, and both appear to have increased ever so slightly at the Great Barrier Reef over the last 100 years.  This is good news \u2013 unreported.  The increase in growth rates may all be part of a natural cycle, or there may be an anthropogenic (human-cause) effect linked to global warming.\nPeter Ridd has been keen to find a human-impact in the many and varied research projects that he has been involved with, many including biologists.  If he had found a negative impact, he would no doubt still have a job doing what he is best at \u2013 teaching, and scientific research.  But science is currently funded and reported in such a way that inconvenient facts are ignored while Dr Ridd who has persisted with the truth \u2013 explaining that The Great Barrier Reef is healthy and reef research has no proper quality controls \u2013 finds himself in a law court and fighting for his job back.\n*****\nGideon Rozner is tweeting live from the Court: https://mobile.twitter.com/GideonCRozner\nIf you would like to read an update from me later today/tonight subscribe for my e-news: https://jennifermarohasy.com/subscribe/\nYou will get more, and different news at: https://ipa.org.au/peterridd\nThe research projects detailed in this article can be explored in more detail at ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Ridd"}, "balanced-16": {"label": 1, "text": "William Happer, Ph.D., President of the CO2\u00a0Coalition,\u00a0Richard Lindzen, Ph.D., a Coalition Director,\u00a0and\u00a0Steven Koonin, Ph.D. responded to a request from\u00a0U.S. District Judge William Alsup to answer questions concerning climate change and climate science for the lawsuit he is hearing in which the cities of\u00a0Oakland, San Francisco, et al. are sing various large\u00a0large oil companies for emitting carbon dioxide and supposedly misleading about the dangers of climate change.\nThis brief is in response provides\u00a0a tutorial on climate change and climate science and shows there are numerous uncertainties concerning the causes and consequences of present climate change, but the best evidence right now indicates a climate catastrophe is not in the offing."}, "balanced-17": {"label": 1, "text": "The Green New Deal (GND) has been costed at\u00a0almost $100 trillion by very knowledgeable experts, or\u00a0about half of total gross national product over the ten years involved. Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey claim that it will save the world. There is a little problem, however. The best scientific evidence is that there would be no significant climate benefits from implementing GND or any other \u201cdecarbonization\u201d policy. You read that right\u2013no significant climate benefits at all.\nHow could this be? The short answer is that the GND authors relied on sources (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC) which also got it wrong, possibly on purpose. Yet much of the left-wing of the Democratic Party has bet their future on the GND. And most of the rest of the Party believes the misnamed \u201cconsensus\u201d science on which it is based. Unusual but true. No US political party has gambled so much on what is basically a scientific scam. Other parties in other countries have done likewise, but a number appear to have lost elections as a result (Australia, for example).\nThe issue involved is whether changes in emissions of CO2\u00a0have a significant effect on temperatures. The IPCC and now much of the Democratic Party claim that they do. But if they does not,\u00a0as shown by the best scientific evidence\u00a0(for a slightly revised version of one study see also\u00a0here.), the GND accomplishes nothing useful to anyone except those that profit from the added government spending involved. I will take the good science rather than the self-serving assumptions made by the climate scammers.\nBear in mind that even if the so-called \u201cconsensus\u201d science should somehow be shown to be correct, perhaps as the result of new research, the results of implementing the GND would not be measurable. So either way GND is a waste of money. In one case the US loses every dollar it spends on decarbonization; in the other it loses most of it but not all, assuming that we do not want a slightly warmer climate, which I believe we do.\nThe underlying scientific issue is whether temperatures determine CO2\u00a0levels or CO2 levels determine temperatures. The scammers claim the latter; the best science says the former. What the scammers want the US to do is to gamble half of national product for ten years that the IPCC assumption on this issue is correct.\nWhat would be far more useful is to carry out research to resolve the basic scientific issue to everyone\u2019s satisfaction (although this may no longer be possible given the willingness of some members of the scientific establishment to put the desired \u201canswer\u201d ahead of the scientific evidence) before spending anything on trying to reduce CO2\u00a0(the miracle molecule that provides food for plants, which provide food for animals, including humans) emission levels. But current science says that changes in CO2\u00a0emissions have had no significant effects on temperatures during the years that we have useful data. Those that ignore the science and rush ahead with the wrong scientific assumption will lose everything they persuade others to spend\u2013in this case half of all US expenditures during 10 years. In other words, on average half of what everyone does for the ten years covered by the GND will be a total loss rather than being an unmeasurable minor effect."}, "balanced-18": {"label": 1, "text": "Fan-bloody-tastic!\nScomo wins!I got drunk twice on Saturday night, firstly between 6 and 8pm when I was drowning my sorrows at the thought of a Shorten government, then secondly when I got home and realised the Coalition had pulled off the most amazing election turnaround in recent Australian history.So I had a double hangover on Sunday, but boy was it worth it.

It is not about science. It is not about energy policy. It is not even about the power and politics. Climate alarmism is like a memetically engineered weapon of mass destruction unleashed on the U.S. and destroying our country from the inside.\nClimate alarmism might be the most dangerous threat the U.S. faces today. The magnitude of this danger can be seen even by the sheer size and sophistication of the media\u2019s attempts to push the Trump administration to compromise with climate alarmism. The regulations remaining from Obama\u2019s term are only the tip of the iceberg and are the least important part of the problem.\nThere is no middle ground between the alarmist and the realist positions today, and there hasn\u2019t been one for about twenty years. Furthermore, the attempts to find a middle ground with climate alarmism eventually led to its growth. Twenty years of trying to appease climate alarmism led to one outcome \u2014 many reasonable people came to the conclusion that the basic tenets of climate alarmism are correct, and that those who reject \u201cclimate actions\u201d do that for some other, possibly ulterior, motives. These motives and reasons are thought to be economics, national egoism, excessive influence of some industries, libertarian ideology, public misunderstanding of science. But the basic tenets are wrong.\nClimate alarmism is a system of beliefs and rituals whose leaders demand our conversion or submission. In other words, it is a cult with a pretense to rule the world. It has been called a cult many times by distinguished scientists, clergymen, and former environmentalists. How can one even think of finding a middle ground or a compromise with such a thing?\nIn practical terms, unless the U.S. government renounces the self-proclaimed scientific authority of IPCC, other UN agencies, associated NGOs and the \u201cconsensus scientists,\u201d it\u2019s going to appear as accepting such authority. This appearance is sufficient for these actors to make any demand on the U.S. and its citizens, alleging scientific support for that demand. By making various demands, and occasionally receiving demanded goodies, climate alarmism accumulated the power it wields now.\nFor example, a few days ago, Rex Tillerson signed The Fairbanks Declaration, which contains phrases like \u201cthe Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide,\u201d\u00a0\u201cthe pressing and increasing need for mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience,\u201d etc. A knowledgeable but naive observer might think: so what? Twice zero is still zero, and \u201cto strengthen resilience\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. Also, this is just a declaration so what\u2019s the harm? The harm is that when the U.S. Secretary of State signs a document containing specific vocabulary and symbolism of the climate cult, that will appear as deference to this cult. In this case, the fakestream media exaggerated the importance of this declaration, amplifying this appearance.\nThere are only two ways of dealing with a cult like this: to submit or to fight. The former is forbidden by the Constitution.\n\u2013 By Constitution, the president must stop the establishment of the climate cult as the state religion. That includes teaching \u201cclimate change\u201d in public schools.\n\u2013 By Constitution, the president must restore the sovereignty of the American people on its soil. Obama\u2019s administration used to fulfill orders by the IPCC and other UN agencies, the orders disguised as summaries of science.\nThe executive branch has no choice on these matters. Also, climate alarmism claims that carbon dioxide produced in human breathing is a pollutant, and acts upon this belief. This country has never tolerated such behavior.\nWe are under attack, and must fight back. But the fight won\u2019t be as hard as it seems. Today, enormous pressure is exerted on the elected administration to keep the U.S. chained to climate alarmism.\u00a0Trillions of dollars\u00a0speak loudly, eloquently, and\u00a0forcefully. But it would be a mistake to think that breaking the chains would increase the pressure, or that yielding would decrease it.\nForeign Policy\nThe international situation can be compared to what existed in Eastern Europe before the fall of Communism, or in the Nazi-occupied countries during WWII. Today, Europe is occupied by climate alarmism. Given no choice, Europeans support the occupant, but when there is a choice they will support the liberator. Well, real life is not that black and white. To paraphrase a fashionable expression among libs, one man\u2019s liberator is another man\u2019s occupant. Nevertheless, most Europeans would prefer liberation from the yoke of climate alarmism. And those who collaborated with the occupant will lay low and stay quiet \u2014 as quiet as they are loud now.\nMany Western governments, centrist, and right-of-center parties are ready to jettison climate alarmism but cannot do so without a firm commitment from the U.S. Any European or British Commonwealth country that would attempt to do that without U.S. support would face its domestic leftists and enviros and the whole \u201cglobal governance\u201d that grew up around climate alarmism.\nDomestic Conditions\nThe U.S. government\u2019s opinion on scientific issues matters. It matters to the general public. It matters to judges at all levels. It matters to the federal agencies, to the state governments, to the businesses and non-profits. It matters even to Pope! Currently, this opinion is expressed in the 2014 National Climate Assessment, which is still posted at\u00a0nca2014.globalchange.gov/report. This report was written under the Obama administration by pseudo-scientists and under the\u00a0leadership of Rockefeller Brothers Fund\u2019s puppet\u00a0(p. 9 of the linked document). It references IPCC papers as if they were holy texts. This report should be annulled, too. Of course, the fakestream media will yell \u201cwar against science,\u201d but it will yell that with the same intensity whether the Trump administration repeals the whole \u201cassessment\u201d or changes just a few words in it. The two terms of George W. Bush (2001-2009) provide an example of the\u00a0pointless kowtowing to the left. Bush bent over backwards and even appointed a Democrat John Marburger as the Science Adviser, and still was hounded by the media, accusing him of \u201csilencing the science.\u201d And the fakestream media will continue smearing President Trump with the same intensity no matter what he does or does not do, so it can be safely ignored.\nBy the way, unlike Obamacare, the ObamaClimate does not need to be replaced, only repealed.\nThe main domestic factor in the climate debate is the huge gravy train carrying the climate alarmism industry forward at the annual rate of hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. alone. This money is stolen from the taxpayers and does not include damages from restrictions on fossil fuel industries. A large chunk of this money feeds the fakestream media. This is why it becomes so agitated on this topic. Of course, those who stand to lose such income, which they receive with no real work or investment, can and do throw a big punch.\nAnd here comes another advantage of the firm renouncement. It empowers the administration to stop the gravy train, to channel its content back to the hard-working Americans, and to claw back some of what has been stolen by the climate alarmism industry over the last eight years. This money will be needed to restore the scientific institutions decimated by Al Gore and his minions. In the process, a small fraction of the recovered funds will rub off on those who aid the recovery \u2014 lawyers, journalists, academics, artists, media personalities, etc. \u2014 and on those who will be the counterweight to the forces of chaos.\nAnother domestic factor is the suppressed dissent among U.S. scientists, engineers, executives, and owners of manufacturing and natural resources industries. Many of them are afraid to speak now. The EPA can quickly destroy a company that employs or contracts with a scientist who speaks up.\u00a0Obama\u2019s DOJ criminally prosecuted engineers\u00a0for simply doing their jobs in the oil industry. The last 8-15 years can be compared to a street gang rule. The victims of the Clinton-Gore-Obama gang will speak up, but only after they see that the sheriff is back in town and is willing to take on the gang even when the media is on its side. George W. Bush was not up to the task.\nThe Trump administration should reject climate pseudo-science decisively and unequivocally, once and forever. Any renouncement of climate alarmism, or ignoring climate pseudo-science will not do the job. Understandably, politicians are not scientists. But climate pseudo-science is hanging by a chain, with which most links are broken. Many links are so broken that everyone can see that after a few days of study. Reading a two-page\u00a0summary of climate debate science\u00a0might be sufficient for some, but even this is not necessary for government officials to act. The government doesn\u2019t have to establish which theory is correct. Science proves itself in nature, in the lab, and in its applications to human needs. If something demands establishment by the government, it is not science. The First Amendment forbids government to establish this \u201csomething.\u201d Climate pseudo-science must be renounced under the First Amendment.\nAs a non-specialist in government affairs, I don\u2019t know what form such firm rejection might take. In my opinion, the main part of it would be President Trump\u2019s address to the American people. Such address would be more important than the G7 summit scheduled for May 26-27. The administration should also send a withdrawal notice as required by the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). That Convention is the only properly ratified \u201cclimate treaty.\u201d The U.S. becomes free from UNFCCC one year after the notice. A withdrawal has been urged in a recent\u00a0petition by eminent scientists and subject matter experts, led by Professor Richard Lindzen. The U.S. is not a party to the Paris Agreement and the parties to this agreement knew that when they signed it. Appropriate messages might be sent to foreign governments and the UN agencies through diplomatic channels. (The message to the European nations: \u201cWe are coming to liberate you!\u201d The message to the UN agencies: \u201cJust make a squeak! We will appreciate an opportunity to defund you.\u201d)\nThe renouncement of climate alarmism is not going to come completely unexpected. There are or will be cabinet discussions, and some news will leak to the media. The public will hear only an increase in the media pitch on the subject, up until the President delivers his address. What happens next?\nWhen the U.S. government renounces climate alarmism, it is a fait accompli. Climate alarmism will explode like a watermelon dropped from the top of the Trump Tower. Media personalities who have been making living off it will get up and go look for the next feeding ground. International organizations will leave us alone and start fighting among themselves over the funds they have. And so on.\nNext, the public and some very important persons will take a harder look at the climate debate. These include top \u201ctech\u201d and media executives, billionaires supportive of liberal causes, Dem politicians at all levels and so on. They will want to learn the arguments of the other side, and some of them will discover that there is no other side. There are laws of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and engineering, and a few hundred men and women unafraid to speak up about them. Then, those VIPs will understand that the enviros and their accomplices in academia have been lying to them all the time, putting at risk their fortunes, careers, and in some cases, their freedom. I think they will be mad as hell. After some agony, the evil climate alarmism empire will crumble. Fixing regulations would become a technical matter, rather than an uphill fight.\nI think that a large part of the Democrat/liberal/leftist camp would then have second thoughts about their ideological and political allegiance. They will see how fake their media became. They will be disgusted by the suppression of the conservative thought committed by the Obama administration and by some government agencies even before it. They will look at many other facts that escaped mainstream discussion.\nFinally, and least importantly, honest believers of dangerous anthropogenic climate change and the supporters of renewable energy sources should not be alarmed by such renouncement. The global consumption of fossil fuels and the emissions of infrared active gases and substances have been growing over the last eight years. Political division made it impossible to take any costly action they believed was necessary. Thus, honest believers should welcome a political reset. It would clean up their cause of corruption, opportunism, and polarization.\nCompetent and honest research in the atmospheric and ocean sciences shall continue after renouncing pseudo-science. Then, the government may resume funding bona fide research and manufacturing in solar and wind energy, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Today, only a small fraction of the funds officially appropriated for such R&D and manufacturing reaches workers, engineers, and scientists. Most of the money is diverted into propaganda and activism. The activists and journalists who receive it are right to be worried, even alarmed. But the rest of us shall welcome the abolition of climate alarmism.\nThe administration becomes slightly more associated with climate alarmism with each day it doesn\u2019t renounce it. Soon, this association will rise to the level of complicity, and it will become an additional factor that prevents action. The opponents of the administration, foreign and domestic, will be able to say something like, \u201cIf climate science and action are so wrong, why did it take you so long to reject it?\u201d\nAsk President Trump to renounce climate alarmism now!\n[Originally Published at\u00a0Watts Up With That]"}, "balanced-20": {"label": 1, "text": "America is in the midst of a cataclysmic battle \u2013 and yet you\u2019ve likely heard very little about it.\nRight now, the 30-year US global warming fight is coming to a pivotal juncture \u2013 within the next few days.\u00a0It is vital that we take immediate action to support President Trump on an important initiative.\nDr. William Happer\u00a0(an eminently qualified scientist in the\u00a0White House) has proposed the\u00a0Presidential Committee on Climate Science\u00a0[or Presidential Commission on Climate Security] (PCCS).\nThe PCCS will bring together multiple qualified scientists who will review such significant issues as global warming\u2019s alleged impact on national security, agriculture, sea levels and extreme weather.

But climate alarmists and their lapdogs in the mainstream media conveniently fail to remember this fact every year when they breathlessly claim a single flood or hurricane, or a busy hurricane season, or a large wildfire is evidence humans are causing dangerous climate change. Those events are weather, not climate, as well.\nWeather isn\u2019t climate. A region\u2019s climate is its geology, topography, and weather patterns and history accumulated, measured, and averaged over long periods of time. We have had record-setting polar vortex events three of the last five years\u2014could it be a trend? NASA recently noted record-low sunspot activity could portend a decades-long period of below-average temperatures. As reported in American Thinker, but not much elsewhere, \u201cMartin Mlynczak of NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center reported in September: \u2018High above Earth\u2019s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy. If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.\u2019\u201d\nAlthough winter storms don\u2019t prove global warming isn\u2019t happening, they definitely contradict predictions made by many of the same climate change charlatans just a few years ago that human-caused climate change would make snow nonexistent, or nearly so, in the near future. As recently as February 2014, the New York Times ran an article titled \u201cThe End of Snow,\u201d and less than a month later the U.S. East Coast was getting pounded with record cold and snow, and some of those records were broken during the 2017 cold spell. Now, locations as far apart as Colorado, Seattle, and Hawai\u2019i are experiencing record-setting snowfall.\nAs a 2014 Daily Caller article reports, in 2000, scientists in the U.K. said global warming would make snowfall a very rare and exciting event, quoting one scientist as saying \u201cChildren just aren\u2019t going to know what snow is.\u201d In 2004, other scientists warned Scotland\u2019s ski industry was set to collapse as warming ended snowfall there. Where were the reporters following up with these scientists in 2014 when record cold and snowfall descended across the United Kingdom and as skiers took to the slopes during Scotland\u2019s 2014 ski season?\nAs to hurricanes, the media were quick to uncritically report some scientists\u2019 claims the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was consistent with climate model projections of more powerful hurricanes. The same stories failed to note that before the 2017 season the United States had gone through the longest period in recorded history\u2014more than 14 years\u2014without a Class 3 or higher hurricane making landfall in the United States. The 14-year hurricane hiatus was completely inconsistent with climate model projections, and the media were silent about that.\nTrue shifts in climate are demonstrated only over hundreds or thousands of years, not dozens of years during which weather \u201cextremes\u201d could be just fluctuations or oscillations around the mean. By contrast, a hypothesis about humans causing imminent, catastrophic climate change which repeatedly makes predictions that fail to match reality, can be reconsidered and discounted much more quickly. Such a reassessment of the hypothesis of looming, catastrophic, anthropogenic global warming is long overdue.\nUnfortunately, because so many scientists have colluded to manipulate and modify hard data to fit their pet climate theory despite copious failed projections and evidence to the contrary, I have come to the conclusion the theory of human-driven climate catastrophe is really more like a religious belief\u2014a revealed truth about human sins (fossil fuel use) and their consequences (all manner of calamities)\u2014and not a scientific explanation subject to falsification by testing.\nNo matter what weather event happens\u2014warmer or colder than usual temperatures for a season or even a single day, more or less moisture than average, more snow or less snow\u2014the answer is human-caused climate change. That\u2019s why they stopped talking about globull warming (pun intended) and instead now talk about climate change: because they couldn\u2019t explain why warming stopped for 18 years despite rising carbon dioxide emissions.\nAlbert Einstein once said, \u201cNo amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.\u201d Einstein\u2019s words express a foundational principle of science intoned by the logician Karl Popper: falsifiability. In order for a hypothesis to be considered scientific, there must be conditions which could prove it false. A thousand observations may appear to verify a hypothesis, but one critical failure can prove it wrong. The history of science is littered with examples.\nAny hypothesis that cannot be falsified is not scientific; it is a religious tenet, a matter of faith. The current hypothesis about anthropogenic climate change should be no exception to this principle, but many scientists and the media treat it as though it is.\nNo matter what the climate phenomenon, if climate alarmists can find a way to present it as unusual, they trumpet it as \u201cfurther evidence humans are causing climate change,\u201d even when it contradicts earlier phenomena the same people pointed to as evidence of anthropogenic climate change.\nIn climate change research, different models looking at the same phenomenon applying the same laws of physics with the same inputs produce dramatically varied results. Thus, one model says we can expect the polar ice sheets to melt, while another predicts the coming of the next ice age, or one model will forecast long-term drought in the Southwest while another model predicts increased precipitation.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: climate change might result in an ice age or planetary desertification, or it might cause an increase of flash floods or more droughts, or it might cause increased or decreased agricultural productivity. But for each pair of diametrically opposed predictions, it can\u2019t cause both to occur at the same time, in the same place. How does one test or disprove a theory that is predicted to cause both an increase and a decrease in the water levels of the Great Lakes in 2100, or whose proponents warn it will cause the polar ice sheets to melt and raise sea levels while bringing about the next ice age and a consequent dramatic fall in ocean levels?\nWhen confronted with inconvenient facts or evidence calling into question one or more aspects of the theory of human-caused climate change, or by arguments that the way climate science is being practiced violates the scientific method, climate alarmists revert to ad hominem attacks, calling the researchers raising such questions names or questioning their motives instead of addressing the substance of their arguments. This response is a hallmark of doctrinaire religious zealots, not of scientists engaged in the back-and-forth exchange of ideas in pursuit of knowledge and truth. That is what the best tradition of scientific discovery is.\nSOURCES: American Thinker; The Daily Caller; National Review; Forbes; USA Today\nIN THIS ISSUE \u2026\nDistinguished climate scientist explains why he\u2019s a skeptic \u2026 New research says no anthropogenic climate signal is evident\nAnastasios Tsonis, emeritus distinguished professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the Atmospheric Sciences Group at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, has written a paper explaining why all scientists should be climate skeptics. Skepticism and enquiry are at the heart of the scientific endeavor, and efforts to shut down debate about the causes and consequences of climate change or claims the science is settled are anti-science, Tsonis writes.\nTsonis notes the use of fossil fuels has been necessary for the evolution of human society and enormous increase in human prosperity. Although changes in climate are important to understand, and \u201cwe should try our best to take care of our planet, \u2026 poverty, infectious diseases and the effect of globalization in spreading them, the water crisis, energy and food availability and safety, political instability and terrorism, the global economy, even cyber security, are far more urgent problems with potentially catastrophic results for humanity,\u201d Tsonis writes.\nAs part of his research, Tsonis and a colleague compared the temperature and precipitation outputs of 23 different climate models used by various agencies and international bodies studying climate change. They found climate models produce widely varied temperature and precipitation projections, with the models neither agreeing with each other very well nor reflecting actual temperature and precipitation amounts or trends. As climate modelers have \u201ctuned\u201d the models over time to force them to agree better with each other, the less their projections correspond with reality.\nTsonis concludes:\nAll scientists should be skeptics. Climate is too complicated to attribute its variability to one cause. We first need to understand the natural climate variability (which we clearly don\u2019t \u2026). Only then we can assess the magnitude and reasons of climate change. \u2026 All model projections made for the 21st century failed to predict the slowdown of the planet\u2019s warming despite the fact that carbon dioxide emissions kept on increasing. Science is never settled. \u2026\nIt is my educated opinion that many forces have shaped global temperature variation. Human activity, the oceans, extraterrestrial forces (solar activity and cosmic rays), and other factors are all in the mix.\nSOURCES: University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Washington Times\nA recent paper by a team of Greek physicists from the Climate Research Group at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, published in the\u00a0Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, concludes \u201cit is not possible to reliably support the view of the presence of global warming in the sense of an enhanced greenhouse effect due to human activities.\u201d\nThe researchers examined the satellite dataset for December 1978 through July of 2018, finding the data did not display consistent warming accompanying the relatively steady increase in carbon dioxide emissions, nor did it show the gradual increase in warming from low to high latitudes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as predicted by the hypothesis human greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming. An additional \u201cidentifiable signature\u201d of anthropogenic global warming would be a combination of tropospheric heating and stratospheric cooling leading to an increase in the height of the tropopause, the area where the troposphere and the stratosphere interface, but the data show no such tropopause increase.\nInstead of rising greenhouse gas levels directly causing higher temperatures, the climate system is complicated, complex, and always changing in reaction to a variety of local, regional, and global factors, on multiple time scales, the researchers conclude.\nSOURCE: Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"}, "balanced-22": {"label": 1, "text": "Bureau of Inconsistencies: Need for Urgent Independent Inquiry\nMINISTER Josh Frydenberg was told by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on, or about, Wednesday 5th July 2017 that limits had been placed on how cold temperatures could be recorded across mainland Australia.\nThis winter we have experienced record low temperatures.\u00a0 \u00a0But only the keenest weather observers have noticed, because the Bureau has been changing the actual values measured by the automatic weather stations.\nIn particular, the Minister was told that while the Goulburn weather station accurately measured the local temperature as minus 10.4 at 6.30 am on Sunday 2 July, a smart card reader prevented this value from being recorded as the daily minimum on the Daily Weather Observations page.\nThe smart card reader had been pre-programmed to round-up any value below minus 10 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 So, instead of entering minus 10.4 into the CDO dataset, the value of minus 10.0 was entered for 2nd July instead.\nThis wrong limit of minus 10.0 was confirmed in an email from the Bureau sent to journalist Graham Lloyd, and also Griffith businessman Paul Salvestrin, on 4th July.\nNo such limits are placed on how hot temperatures can be recorded.\nWhile the Minister has had this advice \u2013 about the smart card readers and the limits on cold temperature recordings \u2013 \u00a0for some weeks, he has claimed publicly that he has full confidence in the Bureau and has resisted calls for an independent inquiry.\u00a0 Further, the Minister has supported the Bureau\u2019s faux solution of replacing the automatics weather station initially at Goulburn and Thredbo, and more recently at many more sites across Victoria and Tasmania.\nAll-the-while, the Minister has known that the problem is limited to the smart card readers.\nTo be clear, the problem is not with the equipment; all that needs to be done is for the smart card readers to be removed. \u00a0So,\u00a0after the automatic weather stations measure the correct temperature, this temperature can be brought forward firstly into the Daily Weather Observation sheet and subsequently into the CDO dataset."}, "balanced-23": {"label": 1, "text": "skeptics beware - climate battle no longer about science\n\"Many climate sceptics are celebrating that 'nothing in the Paris deal is legally binding.'

His ignorance is compounded by the large amount of information on climate change he believes to be true but is just not so.\nTo bolster his argument in support of immediate action, Francis argued wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather are increasing. If we can prevent these terrible catastrophes, Christians should strongly consider embracing measures to limit or end fossil fuel use, Francis said.\nReviewing the data concerning Francis\u2019s claims about extreme weather, however, reveals inconvenient evidence showing so-called extreme weather events are not increasing and an impending planetary doom is not in the offing.\nIl Papa is apparently unaware the modest increase in temperature over the past century and a half has been associated with a huge decrease in severe-weather-related deaths around the world. In the United States, deaths related to weather events have declined by 98 percent over the last 80 years. Heat-related deaths are outnumbered by those due to cold by as much as 20 to one, indicating modestly warmer temperatures would spare many millions from premature death.\nIn addition, contrary to the Pope\u2019s assertions, the United States Drought Monitor shows the area of the United States affected by drought is at its lowest since data collection began.\nMistaken Sea Level Fears\nFrancis has also expressed concern greenhouse-driven warming will drive sea levels to dangerous and unprecedented heights, leading to mass migration and the inundation of entire islands.\nContrary to his belief, the oceans are nearly at historic low levels based on long-term tide gauges and proxy data going back to the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago. Some of the lowest sea levels during our current interglacial period (Holocene) occurred in the mid-1800s and have increased by a little more than a foot since then, at a rate of less than 0.1 inch per year. This rise is due to the beneficial warming that started in the late seventeenth century.\nTo confirm this, Francis needs only to stroll from the Vatican to nearby Portus Traiani Felicus, one of the many Roman ports constructed during or shortly after the time of Christ that are now well inland and meters above our modern sea level. This ancient period of naturally driven high sea levels was due to high temperatures during the Roman Warm Period when citrus was grown in England as far north as Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\nCheck Your Library\nThe Pope\u2019s own voluminous library within the Vatican undoubtedly has information chronicling the close relationship between temperature and the human condition historically.\nContrary to alarming reports from the United Nations and the media, past warming periods were correlated with times of great prosperity and bountiful harvests. Before climate science became politicized, warming periods were known as \u201cclimate optima\u201d because they were beneficial to both the humans and the planet.\nThe rise and fall of temperature is closely tied to the rise and fall of civilizations. Cold periods have historically been correlated with crop failure, famine, pestilence, and mass depopulation, just the opposite of what the Pope has stated.\nAdvancing the Poor\nCurrently, it is estimated pollution from dirty, inefficient cooking and heating fuels\u2014often dung\u2014leads to about 1.6 million premature deaths each year. Nearly half of the world continues to cook with solid fuels that give off a poisonous cocktail of particles and chemicals, which could be avoided through the use of the fossil fuels, such as natural gas, the Pope wants to ban.\nIf the world\u2019s governments adopt the fossil fuel restrictions Francis is calling for, the poor he intends to help would be harmed the most. Abandoning low-cost, reliable energy provided by fossil fuels and embracing expensive, intermittent \u201cgreen\u201d energy, as the Pope proposes, would force the poor to do without economic development for decades and to pay more for energy than is necessary\u2014policies that would only hurt the ones he loves.\nAdvancing the human condition requires full use of all of God\u2019s Creation. Reliable, inexpensive energy is part of the solution which can lift billions of people out of systemic poverty and disease.\nInstead of promoting misguided, harmful policies in a vainglorious attempt to control global temperature\u2014a fool\u2019s errand in any case\u2014Christian leaders should embrace responsible environmental stewardship and energy policies that allow the expanded use of fossil fuels and make energy\u2019s benefits more affordable for everybody, especially the impoverished.\nGregory Wrightstone (gwrightstone@gwrightstone.com), a geologist and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, is the author of Inconvenient Facts: The Science That Al Gore Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know."}, "balanced-29": {"label": 1, "text": "Cooling the Past: Made Easy for Paul Barry\nIt is not disputed that Blair Trewin under the supervision of David Jones (both working at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology) remodel all the historical temperature data generating trends and statistics that look quite different from the actual measurements.\nThe remodelled series are then passed on to university and CSIRO climate scientists who base much of their climate research on these \u2018second-hand\u2019 statistics.\nSo, when Michael Mann and David Karoly tell you it\u2019s getting hotter and hotter, this is their interpretation of Blair Trewin\u2019s statistics, not their interpretation of the actual data.\nWhen I say there needs to be more scrutiny of what Blair does to the actual measurements, I\u2019m simply making a request.\nAs Andrew Bolt explains in his column yesterday harshly entitled \u2018On the deceit of Paul Barry\u2019:\nMarohasy does not say the Bureau is \u201cpart of a huge conspiracy\u201d.

In Germany, the global brown coal industrial powerhouse, emissions at the upgraded Neurath power station are 0.9 tonnes and its planned BOA plant will be 0.75 tonnes.\nSetting new brown coal power station emissions limits at half the level of world\u2019s best practice and referencing a benchmark that uses a different fuel source \u2014 gas \u2014 makes no sense, and is worse than the Finkel Review.\nThe statement also makes it clear that with some exceptions, the government prefers that \u201cnew brown coal projects source their coal from existing mines\u201d which is hard to reconcile with claims to support jobs and industry growth.\nThe only possible outcome is the eventual departure of all existing brown coal generators from the Victorian market with no replacements. Given that coal accounts for around 80 per cent of Victorian electricity, this is a big problem.\nHowever, given that this brown coal policy was announced only two days after\u00a0a $50,000 grant\u00a0to radical environmental lawyers Environmental Justice Australia to \u201chelp Victorians engage in the process of approving projects\u201d on top of the ban on new gas fields and adherence to the 34-year-old prohibition on uranium mining, it is hard to shake the feeling that the Greens are setting the policy agenda\nA feeling reinforced by the astounding\u00a0weekend announcement\u00a0that the Andrews Government would spend $4.7 million on climate change innovation grants and workshops throughout the state, which was\u00a0welcomed\u00a0by Friends of the Earth as it would \u201cbring jobs and investment to regional Victoria.\u201d\nThe Victorian Government should be doing everything it can to support new private sector jobs in mining, develop new brown coal projects and reduce the cost of energy.

There\u2019s only one problem: Barring Star Trek-like discoveries of new energy technologies, it\u2019s not possible. Not even remotely.\nThere are a few \u201cinconvenient truths\u201d about \u201cclean\u201d green energy. First, it\u2019s not all that clean.  Second, the scale of the proposed transition is eye-popping.\nStart with the myth that green energy is \u201cpollution-free.\u201d It\u2019s not. When we read \u201cgreen energy,\u201d most of us probably think about wind turbines and solar panels. But historically, along with small quantities of geothermal power, the biggest single source of green energy has been hydroelectric power \u2014 electricity generated by dams on rivers.\nMost environmentalists don\u2019t like hydroelectric dams because they wreck natural habitats and prevent fish from swimming upstream to spawn. That\u2019s one reason many of those same environmentalists want existing hydroelectric dams, such as the dams constructed by the U.S. government decades ago on the Columbia River, removed. And even if environmentalists didn\u2019t oppose hydroelectric dams, there are few sites for building dams.\nWind power is an environmental disaster. That\u2019s right. Those nice spinning turbines, at least when they spin, slice-and-dice thousands of birds each year. And bats. You may not like bats, but bats are vital for pollinating many crops, especially fruit. Wind turbines also are noisy, emitting low-frequency noise that has well-documented adverse health effects on people who live near them. Then there\u2019s the visual pollution. The wealthy residents off Cape Cod didn\u2019t like the prospect of huge offshore wind turbines despoiling their views, which ultimately sank the Cape Wind project. And most people don\u2019t like 300-foot-tall wind turbines dotting hillsides and mountain ridges. Finally, wind turbines require huge amounts of land because they must be spaced far apart. As my Manhattan Institute colleague Robert Bryce has documented, those environmental issues have contributed to a growing backlash against \u201cbig wind.\u201d\nConstructing wind turbines is highly polluting, too. The turbines require large quantities of rare-earth metals. Most of those are mined outside the United States, such as in Mongolia, where environmental protections are few. The environmental damage has been extensive. Wind turbines also require large amounts of cement for foundations. But cement is manufactured from limestone using a chemical process that releases carbon dioxide. Bye-bye, cement.\nWhat about solar? Although not as spread out as wind, solar still requires lots of space. Sure, you can mount solar panels on rooftops. But rooftop solar is far more costly than large-scale solar facilities. Moreover, the systems of poles and wires that run down our streets aren\u2019t designed to support lots of rooftop solar. To make that possible, those systems will need to be rebuilt.\nBoth wind and solar are intermittent. No wind, no sun, no power. That means building battery storage, lots of it. Here\u2019s one example. New York may enact the Climate and Community Protection Act this year, which calls for zeroing out all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Green New Deal wants this by 2030.\nJust to provide enough battery storage to supply electricity for one cloudy windless day in New York state would require about 1.5 million megawatts of battery storage, the equivalent of 160 million Tesla Powerwalls. By comparison, today, there are about 700 MW of battery storage facilities in the entire United States. And even if current battery storage costs fall by 80 percent, the cost would be $750 billion, according to the Energy Information Administration. That\u2019s just for New York, which accounts for about 4 percent of all U.S. energy consumption. Are green-energy dreamers ready to spend $20 trillion just for battery storage?\nTo meet U.S. energy needs with wind and solar power would require staggering quantities of materials, causing extensive environmental damage, while covering huge swaths of the country with wind turbines and solar photovoltaics. It would require building thousands upon thousands of miles of high-voltage transmission lines \u2014 environmentalists hate those, by the way \u2014 to deliver all of that power to cities and towns. And it would necessitate gigantic quantities of battery storage, costing many trillions of dollars, to deal with two pesky realities: The wind doesn\u2019t always blow and the sun has an annoying tendency to disappear at night.\nMost green-energy dreamers will dismiss everything I\u2019ve said as naysaying or, to use a new Orwellian term, \u201cfact-mongering.\u201d But, try as they might, they cannot overturn the laws of physics or economics.\nWant a realistic clean-energy solution?

Judge Alsup also asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to produce documents related to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and other oil companies conspired to hide evidence of an impending climate disaster.\nMotivated by concern that neither party would present an objective overview of climate science, The Heartland Institute convened a team of scientists to write their own answers to the judge\u2019s\u00a0questions. Unfortunately, that effort was completed too late to submit to the judge. However, the resulting document, presented here, stands on its own as a primer on climate change for anyone looking for a sound foundation in the basic science.\nIn this brief memo, we offer first an overview of the current state of scientific understanding of the human impact on Earth\u2019s climate, followed by some commentary providing context for the eight questions asked by Judge Alsup. Answers to the judge\u2019s questions follow, and then a comment regarding his request for documentation of the claim that the oil industry conspired to mislead the public.\nThe Heartland Institute, publisher of this memo, helped an independent group of scientists submit their own amicus brief, which was received by the judge\u2019s deadline.\u00a0In response to that brief, plaintiffs filed a statement with Judge Alsup filled with inaccurate claims meant to discredit the amici and The Heartland Institute.

What caused the various ice ages (including \u201cthe Little Ice Age\u201d and prolonged cool periods) and what caused the ice to melt? When they melted by how much did sea level rise?\n2. What is the molecular difference by which CO2 absorbs infrared radiation but oxygen and nitrogen do not?\n3. What is the mechanism by which infrared radiation trapped by CO2 in the atmosphere is turned into heat and finds its way back to sea level?\n4. Does CO2 in the atmosphere reflect any sunlight back into space such that the reflected sunlight never penetrates the atmosphere in the first place?\n5. Apart from CO2, what happens to the collective heat from tailpipe exhausts, engine radiators, and all other heat from combustion of fossil fuels? How, if at all, does this collective heat contribute to warming of the atmosphere?\n6. In grade school many of us were taught that humans exhale CO2 but plants absorb CO2 and return oxygen to the air (keeping the carbon for fiber). Is this still valid? If so why hasn\u2019t plant life turned the higher levels of CO2 back into oxygen?

At its worst, the campaign against climate change debate is nothing less than an abuse of office.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, legal officers and elected officials have sought to use the authority of their offices to harass and silence private citizens who disagree with their preferred climate change policies. In November 2015, for example, New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed ExxonMobil, seeking documents that might show the company had downplayed the risk that climate change might pose to future profits, misleading its shareholders. This action was justified by changes in ExxonMobil\u2019s public position on climate change since the 1980s. The subpoena (and intention to prosecute) indicated that the state of New York considers climate change scepticism to be dishonest, that it is not possible to disagree on climate change in good faith.\nThis bullying certitude is extended to groups that support the position of resource companies.\nAs evidence for his accusation of bad faith against those companies, Schneiderman pointed to the work of a number of free-market think tanks, including the American Enterprise Institute and the American Legislative Exchange Council.\nAt the federal level, in July 2016 Senate Democrats sent letters to 22 think tanks demanding they disclose the identities of their donors because of their \u201ccampaign to deceive and mislead about the scientific consensus surrounding climate change\u201d.\nCato Institute president John Allison rightly called this action \u201can obvious attempt to chill research into funding of public policy projects (the senators) don\u2019t like\u201d.\nThe message was clear: how private organisations spend their resources, and how they express and develop their ideas, are matters for the state. The state does not have any concern for the wellbeing of shareholders who, after all, continue to see good returns on their investments. Instead, it cares only that a company the size of ExxonMobil has the power to influence the public debate in a way that conflicts with the state\u2019s own priorities.\nThis determination to intimidate dissenters is not a purely American phenomenon. On September 27, 2006, then-member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson of the Australian Labor Party, sent a letter to a number of companies demanding to know whether they had given financial support to the Institute of Public Affairs or \u201cany other body which spreads misinformation or undermines the scientific consensus concerning global warming\u201d and further demanding that if they had given that support that they cease to do so.\nA member of parliament has no more right to know this information, much less to make this demand, than any other citizen. And yet the demand, outrageous on its face, came under colour of authority. Arguably this was a worse use of Mr Thomson\u2019s letterhead than the reference he wrote for Tony Mokbel.\nDepressingly, this campaign of intimidation has been supported by academia and the media. In September 2015, 20 scientists wrote to President Obama demanding his administration bring anti-corruption charges against \u201cdeniers\u201d in the resource industry. And academics have argued variously that climate change scepticism is \u201cfraud\u201d, \u201ccriminally negligent\u201d and not a form of free speech because it is \u201cinsincere\u201d. One Australian media commentator has argued that it is \u201cepistemologically disingenuous\u201d to always insist on the right of alternative opinions to be heard.\nIn addition, public platforms are denied to climate change dissenters, no matter their credentials. In 2015 Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg agreed to move his research centre to a Western Australian university. But under pressure from academic staff and student activists, the university\u2019s vice-chancellor reneged on the deal. Subsequent discussions with Flinders University floundered immediately as staff and students reacted angrily to the idea that someone might ever produce research they disagreed with.\nThe elite cabal of scientists who dominate climate change research have been militant in shunning those with whom they disagree. Moreover, a lack of respect taints the entire public discussion of climate change. Proponents of climate change action routinely use the word \u201cdenier\u201d to describe climate change sceptics, with the word having been deliberately chosen to invoke a parallel with Holocaust denial. All of this contributes to a powerful chilling effect that, in concert with the state\u2019s campaign of harassment, discourages dissenters from voicing their opinions.\nFreedom of speech is not only valuable in and of itself, it has instrumental value as well. It is only through the contest of ideas that the truth may be apprehended. In science as in politics and all other fields of human endeavour, dissent has the virtue of testing the prevailing arguments, which either fail and fall or survive yet stronger.\nThe peremptory shutting down of debate short\u2013circuits this process. Far from ensuring evidence-based policy prevails, the campaign against climate change free speech endangers scientific research and argument. It sets a terrifying precedent for the abuse of power to shut down policy debate and should alarm citizens and policymakers alike."}, "balanced-38": {"label": 1, "text": "american think tank tells u.n. climate conference why its efforts are futile\nThis is an extract from a 43-page report by U.S. think tank CFACT telling the U.N.

Nevertheless, I suggest that homosexuals as well as atheists be tolerant of his perspective.  In fact, I thank him for having the fortitude to be so upfront in what I perceive as his ignorance.

As an earth scientist \u2013 a geologist \u2013 I like to believe that given the facts, most people with average common sense would be able to figure out for themselves what is real and what is hyperbole. Turns out I may be wrong.\nFirst of all, nobody is going to successfully argue that the earth\u2019s climate does not change. Our planet\u2019s climate changes constantly and we have ample evidence in the geologic record of significant changes both in temperature and in composition of the atmosphere over time. For example, most people accept that about 12,000 years ago the planet was coming out of one of the periodic episodes of cool temperatures referred to as an \u201cice age\u201d. The North American continent was covered in ice to south of the present US-Canada border and the alpine glaciers in our Rocky Mountains are remnants of that. Since then, global temperatures have been slowly warming (we aren\u2019t certain of the cause of that, either) until we find ourselves in the quite comfortable situation we\u2019re in now. It is highly probable that, at some time in the future, another ice age will occur.\nSecondly, it is also accepted that we are in a period of gently rising global temperatures. By best estimates, global temperatures have increased a little over 1\u00b0C over the past 150 years or so, ever since an anomalously cool period referred to as the Little Ice Age when rivers froze over in Europe, crops failed and life was generally miserable for most people for an extended period.\nThere are many factors to consider in this discussion. What began as a warning about \u201cglobal warming\u201d (or \u201cglobal cooling\u201d if you go back to the late 1970s) morphed into warnings about \u201cclimate change\u201d when global temperatures stopped rising in about 2001-2002 in spite of ever-increasing fossil fuel CO2 emissions. At that point, the term \u201cclimate change\u201d came to mean that any weather anomaly or condition could be blamed on fossil fuel CO2 emissions. People pushing the climate scare then claimed that droughts, lower snow fall, greater snow fall, hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, etc. were all a result of increasing fossil fuel CO2 emissions. When \u201cclimate change\u201d seemed to lose its media punch, we were introduced to \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and now we\u2019re into \u201cclimate emergency\u201d.\nSo, if we really and truly are into a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d due to fossil fuel CO2 emissions there should be some overwhelming evidence for it. Otherwise, why try to destroy our energy industry and potentially our whole economy on the back of the AGW theory?\nWell, we do have quite a lot of data on all of the phenomena that the folks promoting the AGW theory like to bring up. First of all \u2013 temperature. We really do have a lot of data on this subject, although much of it does not span the length of time that is required to get a good handle on long term temperature trends.\nFirst is the cyclical nature of temperature over temporal periods of 5 to 10 years. Some periods show temperatures increasing, some show temperatures decreasing. Second is the gentle rising trend over the full time interval of the graphs. As mentioned earlier, there has been a gentle, overall trend to increasing temperature of about 1\u00b0C over the past 150 years or so. It would appear that there is nothing in these data to suggest a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. Just cyclical ups and downs in temperature with a gentle trend upwards since the Little ice Age.\nThis flattening in the temperature trend over almost 15 years has caused a great deal of consternation among those people pushing the AGW theory because fossil fuel CO2 emissions have been increasing steadily as shown on the graph below. According to the data, fully 30% of all fossil fuel CO2 emissions produced by human activities since about 1800 have been produced after 2000. And, according to the most recent WMO data, human-derived CO2 emissions continue to increase. So, this begs the question \u2013 if fossil fuel CO2 emissions are causing global warming and about one third of those have been produced since 2000, why did global temperatures not climb?\nOkay \u2013 so we are left with a bit of a conundrum concerning global temperatures. If increasing human-derived CO2 emissions are supposed to increase global temperatures but global temperatures are; (1) fluctuating on a fairly regular basis over decadal periods, and (2) global temperatures have only been slowly increasing by about 1\u00b0C over the past 150 years or so, how can we justify all the hoopla and hysteria about a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d?\nSo the AGW theory seems to be having a difficult time predicting either global warming or increasing hurricanes. How about snow cover? Will the AGW theory predict more snow or less snow over time? Well, over the past 20 years or so proponents of the theory have predicted that the theory can swing both ways. What do the data tell us? The graph below shows seasonal variation in snow extents for the Northern Hemisphere from 1972 and what does it indicate? In essence, the data tell us that there has been no significant change or trend in areal extent of snow in the Northern Hemisphere during that time period, the time period within which human-derived CO2 emissions have been steadily increasing.\nOnce again, we have plenty of data to look at. Below is a graph that shows burn acreage in the US from 1926 through 2018. As can be readily seen, from a high in 1930 to about 1960, forest fire burn acreage dropped dramatically. From then the trend has been flat with somewhat of a slight upward trend from about 1998 but nothing approaching earlier years. And, looking at the number of fires, shown on the next graph, the trend over the past 10 years has been down.\nSo, on the basis of hard data, it does not appear that there is any \u201cclimate emergency\u201d using forest fires as evidence.\nSea level rise is another metric that AGW theory proponents like to use to cause alarm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to drown!\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re losing islands!\u201d. However, we do know that warming oceans will rise and we also know, as discussed above, that there has been a gentle warming for the past 150 years or so. So, what do the data have to tell us?\nFinally, in spite of all the shouting, vitriol and rhetoric over climate, humans appear to be doing quite well thanks largely to the availability of plentiful, affordable fossil fuels. In just about any metric you\u2019d care to name \u2013 life expectancy, poverty, GDP, food production, etc. \u2013 the world has improved significantly over the past 100 years thanks to increased use of fossil fuels.\nThe first graph below illustrates how dramatically climate-related deaths have dropped over the past one hundred years or so.

I covered the result here.  But, as I covered here, the populist lure of demonised fossil fuels and subsidised renewables remains potent, if ultimately disastrous.\nClimate Economics\nNew wind and solar were said to be cheaper than fossil fuels for electricity generation in studies in the US as in a much touted Australian report.  Commentators are incurious about why therefore all nations have huge subsidies for these renewable energy sources.\nIn Australia, as a result of the unreliability created by subsidised renewables, the government is examining support for 12 \u201cnew on-demand capacity with wholesale costs of below $60/ MWh\u201d. Oddly enough, only one (minor) coal project is listed; two gas projects are being examined for Victoria where state anti-gas policies have created a shortage. But the government abandoned returning to a subsidy free electricity market to bring down prices and instead has opted for an additional consumer subsidy. The Greens policy would eliminate thermal coal, which provides three quarters of electricity supply (coal represents a quarter of exports), and ban new petrol or diesel cars by 2030.\nA study by Brian Fisher, one of Australia\u2019s most respected economists, into Australian policy options to reduce emissions, found the Coalition policy of cutting emissions by 27 per cent involves a tax of $263 per tonne and that of Labor for a 45 per cent reduction would mean a tax of over $900 per tonne (the abolished 2013 carbon tax was $24 per tonne).  Costs of Labor\u2019s policy would be $1.2 trillion (two thirds of annual GDP).\nAs a result of subsidised renewables pushing out lower cost electricity generation, the UK is having to move to a \u201ccapacity market\u201d whereby reliable power gets a guaranteed price.  But a Greenpeace financed push is seeking to prevent this form of subsidy without, of course, seeking to prevent the renewable subsidies.\nGlobal CO2 emissions rose by 1.7 per cent last year, the biggest increase since 2013.  Was not the Paris Agreement supposed to stop this? US emissions increased, but remain below the Paris base 1990 level (due to gas replacing coal in power generation). European emissions fell, while those of China, India and other fast-growing developing countries increased by 5 per cent.  China, having previously retarded its new coal generation developments has this year vastly expanded them.\nThe Deputy head of the Reserve Bank of Australia agrees with the Bank of England that climate change has a systemic effect on the economy. This, he said, is due to the increasing role of renewable energy, together with him having joined the populist chicanery in seeing increased extreme climate events and threats to the Great Barrier Reef.

Hayne appears to believe climate risk should be considered a fiduciary duty for company directors, which under the Corporations Act would mean it attracts a maximum penalty of five years in prison for a breach.\nIt is significant that Hayne chose to deliver his remarks to a left-wing think tank. The CPD is funded by organisations such as the Community and Public Sector Union, which is the chief lobbyist for bigger government and more bureaucrats.\nIt is also significant that Hayne failed to include details to his policy proposal. As a former High Court justice, Hayne should know the perils of poorly worded and vague laws which lack direct accountability. It is also a fundamental principle of the rule of law that legal obligations must be predicable and clear.\nIn justifying his remarks, Hayne said that \u201cinternational opinion is clear\u201d and is \u201cnow firmly behind the need for all entities with public debt or equity to respond to climate change issues\u201d. The opinions \u2013 not facts \u2013 of a small cadre of unelected internationalist bureaucrats should apparently decide if someone living in central Queensland gets to have a job.\nThis is precisely the \u201cnegative globalism\u201d that Prime Minister Scott Morrison criticised in a speech to the Lowy Institute earlier this year.\nIn his speech, Hayne disturbingly asks: \u201cWhat is there left to debate?\u201d Perhaps we could debate the fact that China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases yet is unconstrained by the Paris Climate Agreement, or that nuclear power offers a path to low emissions without economic damage yet remains banned in Australia, or that there are many different opinions about climate change \u2013 just ask Professor Peter Ridd who was sacked by James Cook University for expressing one \u2013 or that the costs of mitigation could exceed adaptation.\nAny of these points must be debated in a manner consistent with the values of a liberal democracy like Australia.\nInstead, Hayne seeks to shut down debate by accusing those who hold a different opinion of \u201cshort-termism\u201d and \u201clearned helplessness\u201d.\nLearned helplessness is a psychology term referring to a belief that someone cannot change something they actually can change. Australia, though, is not in a state of learned helplessness. What Australia does will make no noticeable different to the global climate. Even Australia\u2019s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel said that the impact of Australia ceasing all of its emissions is \u201cvirtually nothing\u201d.\nThis is in part why the Paris Climate Agreement exists. Although Hayne may not have mentioned that, because he would then have to recognise that Australia has committed itself to the deepest cuts to emissions per capita in the developed world.\nThe issue is not just confined to Hayne. High-level executives from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have addressed the CPD on the issue of climate change in the past two years.\nThat is the same RBA which has only met its mandated inflation target twice in the past 20 quarters, the same ASIC which failed in its oversight of the banking sector, and the same APRA which was slammed earlier this year in an independent review for having a poor culture and \u201cvariable leadership\u201d. Yet representatives of those organisations are happy to lecture the rest of Australia on a matter of which they eminently unqualified.\nThe behaviour of Hayne, corporate Australia, and the unelected regulators poses a big problem for the Morrison government.\nAt the heart of the government\u2019s agenda is red tape reduction and a reshaping of the bureaucracy to better serve the interests of mainstream Australia.\nThe work commenced in these areas is good. For example, Ben Morton as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister is working with the WA Labor government to reduce the approval time of major projects in that state.\nBut this good work will likely amount to nothing if those who are at the commanding heights of the Australian public service and industry do not even want to debate one of the pre-eminent policy issues of our time.\nMorrison is starting to clean out the public service. Next stop should be the RBA, the regulators, and those appointed to senior positions on government boards. Drain the swamp."}, "balanced-47": {"label": 1, "text": "Happy New Year! Happy New Tax!\nLyman\u2019s bio can be read\nAs Canadians celebrate the beginning of 2020, their happiness at starting a new year will be dulled somewhat by the realization that January 1 marks the date when carbon dioxide taxes increase yet again.\nThe current system of carbon dioxide taxes, charges on industry, and carbon trading prices is complicated, contrary to the claims that it represents a nice simple regime to encourage reductions in our use of the energy services on which we all depend for heat, light and mobility.\nThe people living in most Canadian provinces are subject to the federal government\u2019s \u201cbackstop\u201d regime. Under this regime, carbon dioxide taxes are applied on oil, natural gas and coal purchases according to their estimated effect on causing carbon dioxide emissions, as measured in tonnes. On January 1, 2020, the rate of the tax increases by a whopping 50 %, from $20 per tonne to $30 per tonne.\nResidents of British Columbia, always eager to be greener than thou, were already paying carbon dioxide taxes of $35 per tonne, the highest in the country, and that tax rate will increase on New Year\u2019s Day to $40 per tonne.\nQuebecers are always treated a bit differently, or manage to negotiate a different deal. In Quebec, energy users are subject not to a carbon dioxide tax but rather the prices that result from an emissions trading system that the province shares with California. Under that system, the companies that consume and/or sell fossil fuels must either reduce their emissions to meet a regulatory limit or buy enough permits under a unified California-Quebec permit auction system. In the last auction, held on November 19, 2019, the reserve price was $20.64 per tonne and the median allowance price actually paid was $22.73 per tonne. So, in November 2019 Quebecers paid more per tonne for their carbon dioxide permits than residents of most other provinces paid in carbon dioxide tax. Surprisingly, for the next auction to be held on February 19, 2020, the reserve price will be only $16.34 per tonne. It remains to be seen what will actually be bid.\nThirty dollars per tonne is equivalent to about seven cents per litre of gasoline.\nNext year, we will all get to celebrate another rise in the cost of our energy.\nI hope the Grinch did not steal your Christmas.

The panel would conduct an independent review of the science that underpins official government climate reports, such as the latest National Climate Assessment.\nWith the media hyping fears of anthropogenic climate change for some 30 years, one might be forgiven for thinking everything that could be said or discovered about the topic had been discussed, but you would be wrong. Indeed, as John Droz writes, \u201cAmerica absolutely needs outside expert review of climate claims used to oppose fossil fuels [because] as incredible as it may seem, US government climate science has never been subjected to any such examination.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a common misunderstanding, due to the fawning portrayal of its work by the mainstream media, that the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has objectively studied and presented the facts about climate change. IT HASN\u2019T!\nIPCC, as the name implies, is a political organization, not a scientific one. As such, IPCC was not charged with examining the causes and consequences of climate change but was instead directed from its founding to limit its enquiries into the \u201chuman causes\u201d of change. One can\u2019t understand a problem by studying only one aspect of it. It\u2019s like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, if all the blind men had only been allowed to touch the trunk.\nMany scientists have advanced their careers and raked in big government research grants by toeing the IPCC\u2019s party that line humans are causing dangerous climate change and we need a government takeover of the economy, something like the Green New Deal, to fix it. Time and again, researchers and organizations have manipulated or altered data, and they have suppressed research questioning the extent to which humans are contributing to climate change, and whether said climate change is dangerous, to make the facts conform to their politically convenient theory.\nIn a press release announcing the release of the multiparty letter supporting Trump creating PCCS, Tim Huelskamp, Ph.D., president of The Heartland Institute, described the need for the committee.\n\u201cAn unbiased, independent examination of the science of climate change by an official government body is long overdue,\u201d said Huelskamp. \u201cIt\u2019s only necessary because government bureaucrats have put ideology above science and excluded the wealth of data and research that undermines their narrative that human activity is the main driver of catastrophic climate change.\u201d\nAs the letter states:\n\u201cIn our view, an independent review of these reports is long overdue. Serious problems and shortcomings have been raised repeatedly in the past by highly-qualified scientists only to be ignored or dismissed by the federal agencies in charge of producing the reports. Among major issues that have been raised and that we hope the commission will scrutinize: the models used have assumed climate sensitivities to CO2 concentrations significantly higher than recent research warrants; the models used have predicted much more warming than has actually occurred; predictions of the negative impacts of global warming have been made based on implausible high-end emissions scenarios; the positive impacts of warming have been ignored or minimized; and surface temperature data sets have been manipulated to show more rapid warming than has actually occurred. \u2026\n\u201cThe conclusions and predictions made by these reports are the basis for proposed energy policies that could cost trillions of dollars in less than a decade and tens of trillions of dollars over several decades. Given the magnitude of the potential costs involved, we think that taking the insular processes of official, consensus science on trust, as has been the case for the past three decades, is negligent and imprudent. \u2026\n\u201cWe note that defenders of the climate consensus have already mounted a public campaign against the proposed commission. We find this opposition curious. If the defenders are confident that the science contained in official reports is robust, then they should welcome a review that would finally put to rest the doubts that have been raised.\u201d\nHapper is the perfect person to shape PCCS and direct its work. Before joining NSC, Happer had a distinguished career in academia and in government service. He was the Cyrus Fogg Brackett professor of physics, emeritus, at Princeton University, served as the director of the Office of Energy Research at the U.S. Department of Energy, and is a fellow the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\nHe is also a longtime friend of The Heartland Institute, having spoken at two of Heartland\u2019s 12 International Conferences on Climate Change and having received the Frederick Seitz Memorial Award, created to recognize scholars who\u2019ve had the courage to \u201cswim against the tide\u201d of conventional thinking on climate change despite the financial and professional disincentives.\nWe at Heartland recommend as PCCS examines and debates the causes of current climate change and its purported impacts on national security, agriculture, sea level, and extreme weather, it avail itself of the multivolume, thoroughly researched and peer-reviewed studies published by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, in the Climate Change Reconsidered Series. These documents can serve as the basis for further debate or to supplement the other research materials PCCS will undoubtedly review.\nIn addition, as climate change\u2019s impact on national security promises to be a particular focus of PCCS, The Heartland Institute released a new Policy Brief titled \u201cGlobal Warming Energy Restrictions Threaten U.S. National Security,\u201d disposing of claims human-caused climate change poses a threat to national security, showing instead proposed restrictions on the use of fossil fuels pose the real danger to U.S. national security and continued economic prosperity.\nIn the end, from the perspective of climate alarmists opposed to the PCCS, Trump\u2019s big sin in forming PCCS is to question the claim climate science is settled, and Happer\u2019s big sins are to defend the need for high-quality data and to point out a modestly warmer world and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will bring benefits as well as costs. All the panic, hyperbolic gnashing of teeth, and name-calling accompanying speculation concerning PSSC in recent weeks comes down to this.\nThis is certainly not an anti-science conspiracy. Neither good science nor sound policy can be advanced without an unbiased examination and debate of the facts, the cornerstone of scientific discovery.\nSOURCES: Competitive Enterprise Institute et al.; Epoch Times; The Heartland Institute; The Heartland Institute; Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change\nIN THIS ISSUE \u2026\nUnions break with Democrats over GND \u2026 Frac sand mining isn\u2019t causing air pollution\nUNIONS BREAK WITH DEMOCRATS OVER GND\nTrade unions, often considered a reliable constituency for Democrats, are speaking out against the Green New Deal (GND), a plan to remake America\u2019s economy to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, embraced by a number of Democrats who\u2019ve declared their candidacy for the party\u2019s nomination for the 2020 presidential election.\nAmong its plethora of liberal policy proposals, GND aims at ending fossil fuel use for electric power and transportation, and it calls for the upgrading or replacement of all existing buildings in the United States by 2030.\nA letter sent to Rep.

They level misguided attacks to halt fracking and natural gas development and use, both directly by trying to halt existing fracking operations and preventing new fracking wells from being developed, and indirectly by preventing pipelines from being constructed to carry natural gas from wells to market, or by preventing the mining of the sand used to prop open fractures thousands of feet below the ground to allow the natural gas to flow freely and be captured by wells.\nBecause the connection between frac sand mining and climate change is so indirect, those opposed to frac sand operations have attacked by claiming it causes dangerous local air pollution. The Heartland Institute disposed of this falsehood with an extensive study of the issue in 2017, by Isaac Orr and Mark Krumenacher. Orr and Krumenacher surveyed the literature and found the best available scientific data collected by state agencies and nationally respected air monitoring scientists using EPA-certified equipment and sampling methodologies, show industrial sand facilities do not contribute hazardous levels of air pollutants, neither respirable crystalline silica nor particulate matter (PM), and therefore do not pose a threat to human health.\nBy contrast, opponents of frac sand mining cited work of Dr. Crispin Pierce, from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire\u2019s Environmental Public Health program, and his students to claim frac sand mining was causing dangerous levels of air pollution nearby. As Heartland\u2019s study showed, Pierce\u2019s research was seriously flawed, based on a poor research methodology using uncertified sampling equipment, and as a result Orr and Krumenacher concluded Pierce\u2019s study \u201cis so poorly designed it has no value for furthering our understanding of the impact of frac sand facilities on air quality. In fact, it reflects poorly on the university.\u201d\nJump forward two years, and Pierce and his students have produced a new study they claim was needed to fill data gaps at some sites around Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. I don\u2019t know whether Pierce improved his data collection methodology or equipment, but I do know his work came to a starkly different conclusion than before: Pierce\u2019s students found no evidence frac sand mining was causing a dangerous increase in fine particulate matter, a pollutant produced by truck traffic, farming operations, and combustion.\nAt 7.7 micrograms per cubic meter in 50 24-hour samples taken over two years, air quality measurements taken by Pierce\u2019s students near a frac sand mine near Bloomer, Wisconsin found particulate matter measurements were modestly elevated when compared to 4.33 microgram per cubic meter background levels the Department of Natural Resources monitor at the site is calibrated to. This is well below the 12 micrograms per cubic meter standard established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as safe. The sampling could not confirm whether the modestly elevated particulate matter levels were due to frac sand mining or to nearby truck traffic and agricultural activities such as plowing fields and harvesting crops.\nThe only samples in the area modestly violating EPA\u2019s standards for very short periods, although also not considered dangerous, were not associated with frac sand mining but instead were measured at two processing and train-loading facilities.\nThe Leader-Telegram reports Pierce admitted in public comments his most recent findings were \u201cnot alarming,\u201d and quoted him saying \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing very, very dangerous levels [of particulates].\u201d\nSOURCES: Eau Claire Leader-Telegram; Townhall; The Heartland Institute"}, "balanced-49": {"label": 1, "text": "Bureau Misleads Minister Frydenberg on Goulburn\nRATHER than admit that temperature dropped to a record low -10.4 degree Celsius on the morning of Sunday 2nd July at Goulburn, the Bureau of Meteorology has come-up with yet another even more absurd story.\nResponding to a letter from Josh Frydenberg, the Minister for\u00a0 Environment and Energy, Andrew Johnson, CEO and Director of Meteorology, has claimed the weather station malfunctioned. \u00a0Previously the Bureau claimed that they had placed new limits on how cold it could get at Goulburn.\nThis is a contrived story, easily disproven with the following evidence.\nWe know that the Goulburn AWS recorded -10.4 on the morning of Sunday 2nd July from a  screen shot taken from the observation page\u00a0at the Bureau\u2019s website:\nSubsequently, the Bureau sent an email confirming:\n\u201cThe correct minimum temperature for Goulburn on 2 July, 2017 is -10.4 recorded at 6.30am at Goulburn Airport AWS\u2026 The Bureau\u2019s quality control system, designed to filter out spurious low or high values was set at -10 minimum for Goulburn which is why the record automatically adjusted.\u201d\nIn short, after initially recording -10.0 in the CDO dataset, this was changed to -10.4 three days later following a blog post (\u00a0Bureau Erases Goulburn Record Minimum),\u00a0an outcry on Facebook, and enquires from prominent journalists.\nBy 28th July when the above letter was sent to the Minister, the correct value of -10.4 had been showing in the CDO dataset for some 23 days.\nYet in the letter from the Bureau\u2019s Johnson to Minister Frydenberg it is claimed that:\n\u201cthe AWS at Goulburn stopped recording when the temperature fell below -10\u00b0C.\u201d\nThis is demonstrably false.\nThe Bureau has mislead the Minister \u2013 yet again."}, "balanced-50": {"label": 0, "text": "Stoned 'Tarzan' arrest at zoo\nPublished: Wednesday, August 5, 2015, 4:36 PM Updated: Wednesday, August 5, 2015, 4:36 PM A half naked military_man who covered himself in mud and tried to swing his way into the monkey expose at the Santa Ana, Calif., zoo was in_all_probability under the influence of drugs, policetold TV Station KTLA.

Since August 2018, when 15-year-old Greta Thunberg began a solo \u201cschool strike for the climate\u201d, the teenager has become the improbable face of climate activism. Our House Is On Fire is, among many other things, the story of how and why Greta came to be sitting on the paving out_of_doors the Swedish parliament with a home-made placard. The ledger is co-authored by Greta, her mother Malena Ernman (the primary narrator), her Fatherhood Svante and her sister Beata. It is an urgent, lucid, courageous account.\n\u201cThe personal is political\u201d was a rally vociferation for 1960s demonstrators, and the slogan apply neatly here. The first quarter of Our House Is On Fire describes events in 2011, when Greta slump into imprint and the family\u2019s expectations kick_the_bucket \u201coff-script\u201d \u2013 for good. She \u201cwas tardily disappearing into some kind of darkness and little by little, bit by bit, she seemed to stop functioning. She break bring the piano. She stop laughing. She stopped babble_out \u2026 She stopped eating.\u201d\nThe Holy_Writ wastes no time in dispelling any notion that Sweden is a utopia of public services. The verbal_description of perplex help and a diagnosis out of the adolescent psychiatrical services \u2013 \u201cWhere everyone is burned out from struggling with a constantly originate work_load and where much of the time is spent putting out fires\u201d \u2013 will have parents across the cosmos groaning with grim recognition. Not a dispense serious is mainstream education, \u201cwhere all schoolchild must function in incisively the same right_smart and where overworked teachers on a conveyor belt end up hitting the wall\u201d. Greta was bullied, her educate was indifferent, she lost 10kg in 2 months and extend_to the brink of hospitalisation before she was, eventually, diagnose with obsessive compulsive disorder, selective muteness and Asperger syndrome. Her sister, in time, was diagnose with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. To live_on with these weather_condition is very tough: to care for children living with them and to keep your marriage afloat is besides very tough, and buns the book\u2019s matter-of-fact prose, Greta\u2019s nurture emerge as involuntary superheroes and recipient_role of no award but hard-won wisdom: \u201cPerhaps we will ne'er be fine, but we can always mystify a little bit better, and there is strength in that. There is hope in that.\u201d\nThe middle poop of the Christian_Bible stay in touch with the up-and-down progress of Greta\u2019s family, but focussing on the climate crisis and its core on politics, feminism, economics, ecology, psychology and sociology. Don\u2019t be put off by these \u201c\u2013ologies\u201d: the book is a highly clear chronological_succession of shortish \u201cscenes\u201d written in the direct language Greta U.S.A. in her speeches. The life-vest of humour inflates more often than you\u2019d expect, and the text is dot with subversive, persuasive maxims: \u201cCarbon countervail is like pay hapless people to diet for us\u201d; \u201cThe truth is just another of those affair that can be bought with money\u201d; \u201cWhen you\u2019re use to privilege, equality feels wish oppression\u201d. I write down several pages of quotation for this review until it get ridiculous: I was copying out half the book.\nWhile many readers will be familiar with lots of the science and the contradictions of \u201call you can eat\u201d consumerism, the Christian_Bible also explores the less obvious circuitry that connects apparently disparate things. One impactful passage links our \u201cwinners take all\u201d culture with the explosion of mental sickness suffered by the \u201closers\u201d (as defined by the winners) who are disproportionately female, neuro-diverse and/or socially maladroit \u2013 people not unlike Greta Thunberg. Autistic people, as Greta famous in her 2018 Ted Talk, tend not to be good liars, either to others or to themselves. Greta\u2019s initial depression was triggered by her lack of the neurotypical talent to compartmentalise fact A \u201cWe know we are destroy our planet with bacchic overconsumption\u201d (my words) safely away from fact B \u201cWe carry on regardless.\u201d This talent lets America neurotypicals function as inconvenient truths bundle up but it also prevent the_States from relieve_oneself the systemic change needed to avert ecological collapse. Famously, Greta has described her Asperger\u2019s as a \u201csuperpower\u201d and the point is well-made. Single-mindedness and immunity to flattery and step are all_important caliber for activism. (Writing as the pappa of an autistic young man, I sentiment Greta Thunberg as a default autism advocate as well as a climate activist.) In some quarters, however, this way of intelligent is a crimson flag to a bull. \u201cGreta provokes,\u201d observe her mother. \u201cIn certain cases to such an extent that usually respectful people lose their composure. Not only does she articulate that everything has to change, she has autism too. And she has the irk to gas about it. That\u2019s not how things are say to work.\u201d\nGreta\u2019s parents issue as involuntary super\u00adheroes and recipient of no awards but hard\u2011won wis\u00addom\nTo engage with the climate crisis is to engage with mood crisis denial. A gyration in how we subsist is needed, and no revolution can succeed without broad support: otherwise, it\u2019s a doom putsch. Our House Is on Fire makes this engagement with acuity drawn from a deep well of hard-won experience. \u201cOur future bionomical submit has been reduced to a political game where it\u2019s word against word, and the most popular wins. And guess which climate and sustainability story sells the best? The one that demands change or the one that says we can continue shopping and fly for all eternity?\u201d\nPiety \u2013 these daylight rebranded as virtue signalize \u2013 is notability in the book by its absence: \u201cThey say that climate change denier are idiots. But everyone is a climate change denier. Every individual one of us.\u201d The trolls of Greta Thunberg (whose prestigious rank include Presidents Trump, Bolsonaro and Putin) are see with an worked_up intelligence that is rarely, if ever, reciprocated. The message that business as usual is the opposition is not a welcome one for those of U convey business as usual. Far comfier to dismiss the messenger as a mentally poorly brat, or the stooge of eco-fascist lizard people hellbent on establishing their own World State, than to admit blameworthiness in ecocide. Far wanton to dismiss the science as biased, as false, as \u201cnot settled\u201d. The job is that with every swath of Australia or California burned, every never-before inundate city flooded, every hurricane of record-breaking destruction, and every Florida\u2011sized ice-shelf part off from Antarctica, the same substance gets affirmed: that clientele as usual will roast us, overwhelm U or starve us.\nThe net quarter of the book describes the tension-filled day leave up to Greta\u2019s Skolstrejk f\u00f6r klimatet outside the Swedish parliament. There are reasons some thing go viral and some things don\u2019t. There is an ancient power in symbolization and narrative. There is a powerful magnetism in the defiance of the powerless. These are glimpsed in a scene during a meeting with climatologists and family friend in Uppsala: \u201cThere is a pause. These thinking take over the room \u2013 that the almost unseeable little miss on the chair by the window is planning to set herself at the very heart_and_soul of the spotlight, and, all alone, in her own thought_process and words, question the foundation of the die_hard human_race order.\u201d Greta\u2019s parents\u2019 anxieties about expose their 15-year-old daughter to incoming pom-pom from any ill-disposed passerby in Stockholm are cope_with by Greta\u2019s resolve to microscope_stage her smasher no matter what, and by a growing sense that activism is a strange kind of cure.

The proposal, which would have wreak 260,000 new flying a year to the airport, was drained and campaigners celebrated because standardised schemes were now doomed.\nBut are they? It\u2019s tempting to prognosis the future use simple suit and effect, strike that the court of solicitation opinion must now cause Heathrow and similar climate-busting jut to stop, thus speed_up Britain\u2019s transition to a carbon-free economy. But sadly, that\u2019s just one potential scenario. The burden of the ruling could be to expand smaller, regional airports. Most Heathrow flights are for pleasure; find_out traveller could pile into Luton, Stansted, Birmingham. More might decide to drive. Even though the regime says it won\u2019t appeal, the transport minister, Grant Shapps, has also said, in principle, it does \u201cwant to date airport expansion\u201d. Heathrow will appeal against the decision. It could win. Nature could quieten lose.\nThe future is uncertain because cause and effectuate are rarely simple. A unmarried cause can have any add_up of effects, some predictable but many unforeseen. Something can be generally certain \u2013 such as the law courts having to take the government\u2019s commitment to the Paris pact badly \u2013 but specifically ambiguous: because no two externalise are identical, all future judgments English_hawthorn not favor the environment.\nMinor differences in projects whitethorn result in widely varying outcomes. You can see the same difficulty with epidemics. That they will keep_back happening is generally certain, but it is bad to extrapolate from one to the other because there is no profile of an epidemic. We don\u2019t know where or when the next epidemics will breach out, or what disease might causal_agency them. They don\u2019t repeat themselves. Expecting to take_care the future through a simple flowering of suit and consequence is light but risky.\nBut simple cause-and-effect call_back has plagued forecasting since telling the next become big occupation at the terminate of the 19th century. One of the founding fathers of economic forecasting, Roger Babson, was adamant in his Newtonian view of the world. For him, every action had to be consort with an equal and opposite reaction. He not only foregather the enceinte collection of Newtoniana in North America, but ground his total economic theory on this premise, i of the first (but not the last) to believe he could train laws of economics that had the same absolute certainty as the laws of physics.\nHis view of cause and effect had a hike_up in 1929 when, as he had predicted, Wall Street crashed. This, Babson argued, was because period of wasteful exuberance incessantly develop the need for sensible self-discipline. But he had been auspicate a fudge_factor for the previous leash years. And when, in May 1931, he announced the market had bottomed out and it was fourth_dimension to get back in, he was wrong: the US economic_system didn\u2019t recover for a decade.\nSimple make make memorable stories, but the sheer complexity of life militate against aboveboard narratives\nLike most pundits, Babson was poor at reviewing his own forecasts; he extend to believe everything in life could be dilute to simple-minded laws. As a young man, he was order he had contract TB \u2013 at the time, the bingle corking cause of death in the western world. However shattering, the diagnosis was all_the_same ambiguous: it could mean a quick end or that the disease would dwell latent for decades. Not a piece to suffer by and wait, Babson devised a health regimen that he was convinced would keep catastrophe at bay.\nHe choose an office besiege by windows, all of which he keep all-inclusive open, even passim the barbarous Massachusetts winters. He and his secretary fatigue mitten and hooded, floor-length wool clothe as they worked, the secretary typewrite with wooden mallet and Babson jade an electrically stir_up pad_of_paper in his back. Was it these eccentricity that earmark Babson to survive to 91? It\u2019s impossible to know. He mightiness not even have had TB, since no accurate test was devised until years later.\nThe same problem frustrate survey of leadership. It is stylish to accompany high-profile business leaders and attractor from them lessons of success. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates created huge, valuable companies \u2013 but how far was their success attributable to them as individuals, and how far the result of other factors: the thousands of people who work for them, the short-sightedness of their competitors, the loaded ecosystem they inherited, and a ontogeny educated populace? It\u2019s impossible to do the experiment, Apple without Jobs, or Microsoft without Gates.\nSeeing soul as single campaign of complex success is an ascription mistake routinely make when analyse politicians too: did Churchill in_truth win the Second World War, or were Hitler\u2019s unforced errors and the brute force of the Soviet Union more important?\nSimple causes make memorable stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re true. The cut complexity of living militate against straightforward tale and it can feel as though the sides have come off the billiard table, formal drop off or arriving from anywhere. You don\u2019t love how many variable there are, where they Crataegus_laevigata seminal_fluid from or which, if any, will matter. That\u2019s why, increasingly, efficiency give way to robustness.\nWhen the hazard are high (as in epidemics) a bold response is safer than complacency. Which is why the campaigners fete last week\u2019s appeal motor_lodge judgement will have to return to their fight if they want to growth their probability of environmental success.\n\u2022 Margaret Heffernan is the writer of Uncharted: How To Map the Future Together"}, "balanced-62": {"label": 0, "text": "Obama 'damaging the presidency' with in-migration plan, top Republican says\nSpurning furious Republicans, U.S. President Barack Obama unveil expansive executive process on immigration Thursday night to extra from deportation about five million people in the U.S. illegally and to refocus enforcement exploit on \"felons, not families.\" The moves, affecting for_the_most_part parents and untested people, marked the most sweeping changes to the nation's fractured in-migration police in nearly 3 decades and arrange off a fierce fighting with Republicans over the limits of presidential powers.

Clearly, the 415 ppm level today greatly exceeds the maximum records in this time period (which topped out during interglacial times at less than 300 ppm). For more ancient times we have to use proxy measures, that is, measurements of other things like the density of pores (stomata) on fossil leaves (calibrated with greenhouse data) or the boron content of fossil shells (sensitive to the CO2 content of the surface ocean, which is tightly linked to the atmosphere). Those proxies give somewhat different results as we go further back in time, but none indicate levels above 415 ppm before about 2.6 million years ago, and only one measurement I know of shows this; the next cluster is at around 3 million years (see, for example, Wang et al, 2015).

We know that climate change is enhancing extreme rainfall. As the atmosphere is getting warmer it can hold more moisture (roughly 7% more for every 1\u00b0C rise in temperature). This means that when we get the right circumstances for very extreme rainfall to occur, climate change is likely to make these events even worse than they would have been otherwise.

That in turn is a consequence of the specific weather situation, in which the storm is caught between two high-pressure systems and the jet stream is too far away to the north to pull it away. In other words, it has just been sitting and dumping its huge quantities of rain in the same area for days, rather than spreading it out over a long track as a typical storm would. There are some ideas in the scientific literature that suggest that global warming may make this situation more probable. However, these ideas are still speculative and not widely agreed upon by scientists."}, "balanced-94": {"label": 0, "text": "There are other factors that are making this storm worse than others in terms of its impact.

This means that when there is extreme rainfall the water takes longer to drain away, prolonging and intensifying the floods.

The statement reads: \u201cScientists estimate 90 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution and over-development.\u201d I am not familiar with every projection by every scientist, but it is not unlikely that some scientists have made such an estimate and it is possible that they could be right.

Instead, what the science clearly indicates is that if we continue emitting greenhouse gases at our current rate, by mid-century tropical ocean temperatures in many regions will be high enough (1-2 C warmer than today) to cause regular (annual to semi-annual) bleaching events.

The loss of the corals is tragic and affects the functioning of the ecosystem, but still, Caribbean reefs lacking much coral can still be inhabited by a stunning diversity of fishes and invertebrates and staggering densities of animal life not seen in any other habitat on earth.
